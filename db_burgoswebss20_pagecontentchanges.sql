The town was first named “San Isidro” in honor of its patron saint. However, since there was another town named San Isidro located along the coastline of Lingayen Gulf, the residents decided to add “<em>potot</em>” to the town’s name to prevent confusion when mails and other communications are sent. The extra name was added because of the Amborayan stream which traverses the municipality appears to be cut or in Ilocano “<em>potot</em>”. Even with this addition in the town’s name, the confusion still continued as mails meant for San Isidro <em>Potot</em> were sent wrongly to San Isidro de Labrador and those of the latter were wrongly sent to the former.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To solve the people and the local government’s confusion, the name of the town was finally changed to Burgos after the famous Filipino martyr-priest who was executed by the Spanish colonizers in 1872 thru the very painful “<em>garrote</em>” (strangulation). The renaming of the town was implemented in 1913.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The early settlers of Burgos, Pangasinan were migrants from Paoay, Ilocos Norte who were led by Don Matias Guiang. Using boats, they first landed at the nearby area into what is now known as the Municipality of Agno, they then proceeded up the river and settled in the wide plateau covered with virgin forest which was traversed by a stream now called \"Amborayan\". The Amborayan is very different from other streams because its waters flow to a precipice about a hundred meters deep so that it looks to be a broken stream. No one could go down the stream until its junction at the big river. Because of the precipice, it was popularly called a \"<em>potot</em>\" stream. Soon, the settlement grew and became thickly populated. In 1830, the people led by Don Matias Guiang petitioned the Governor of Zambales which was at that time has jurisdiction over the area, for the elevation of the settlement into a <em>pueblo</em> or town. The request was granted and Don Matias Guiang was appointed as the first <em>Gobernadorcillo</em>or Governor of the town.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>During the Spanish regime, the town was under the jurisdiction of the Province of Zambales especially when it was elevated to a formal town from its former status as a settlement. In November 30, 1903 by virtue of Act 2390 of the Philippine Commission, the now Municipality of Burgos including eight (8) other neighboring towns were separated from Zambales and ceded to the Province of Pangasinan. In 1921, Barangay Poblacion was made as the seat of the local government of Burgos.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'Brief History', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '35-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-09-12 11:03:51', '2020-09-12 11:03:51', '', 35, 'https://localhost/git/burgos-website/?p=36', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

All the barangays especially those located in coasts are at risks. Since many of the houses in the municipality are made of light materials, these structures are placed at great risk of damage during typhoons. Stronger typhoons now visit the municipality are also expected to be so because of climate change. In as much as Burgos also has a coastline, tsunami risk may also be considered. The municipality still needs to develop tsunami as well as an earthquake emergency operations plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The El Nino phenomenon also constitutes a risk for Burgos. Farms engaged in rain-fed farming are very dependent on ample rain. With irregular rains, more irrigation facilities or water impounding systems are needed. Prolonged monsoon winds as a result of climate change are another risk area for the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Natural disasters including floods, tropical cyclone, droughts brought by climate change which confront the municipality challenge agriculture production.  Agricultural impacts from natural events and disasters most commonly include: contamination of water bodies, loss of harvest or livestock, increased susceptibility to disease and destruction of irrigation systems and other agricultural infrastructure.  These could have long lasting effects on agricultural crops, forest growth.

Soil erosion along these areasis also observed. The agro-forest areas also constitute environmental critical areas in the municipality and therefore have to be protected from unregulated interventions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>High risks for the municipality are the typhoons. All the barangays especially those located in coasts are at risks. Since many of the houses in the municipality are made of light materials, these structures are placed at great risk of damage during typhoons. Stronger typhoons now visit the municipality are also expected to be so because of climate change. In as much as Burgos also has a coastline, tsunami risk may also be considered. The municipality still needs to develop tsunami as well as an earthquake emergency operations plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The El Nino phenomenon also constitutes a risk for Burgos. Farms engaged in rain-fed farming are very dependent on ample rain. With irregular rains, more irrigation facilities or water impounding systems are needed. Prolonged monsoon winds as a result of climate change are another risk area for the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Natural disasters including floods, tropical cyclone, droughts brought by climate change which confront the municipality challenge agriculture production.  Agricultural impacts from natural events and disasters most commonly include: contamination of water bodies, loss of harvest or livestock, increased susceptibility to disease and destruction of irrigation systems and other agricultural infrastructure.  These could have long lasting effects on agricultural crops, forest growth. According to the flood map of the region, the agricultural areas in the locality are categorized as being moderately susceptible to flooding.  Risk estimation and Vulnerability Assessment places the entire agricultural land of the municipality in low susceptibility to flooding and are projected as low risk areas.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>2.

This length consists of National roads (12.4 km), Provincial roads (23.42 km), Municipal roads (7.879 km), and Barangay roads (146.684 km). The national road is the Matias- Guiang road. More of the roads are barangay roads (77.05%). The provincial roads comprise 12.30% of the total road network, followed by the national roads at 6.51% and finally the municipal roads at 4.14%.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Most of the provincial and municipal roads have already been concreted (80% of the provincial and 85% for the municipal roads. On the other hand, 96% of the12.4 km stretch of national roads is asphalted. Many of the barangay roads which comprise a greater proportion of the road network are still paved with gravel. 20% of the barangay roads are concrete, 1% is asphalted and 70% is gravel.&nbsp; The remaining 9% of barangay roads remain to be dirt roads.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Municipal Social Welfare and Development Office (MSWDO) is social welfare arm within the Municipality of Burgos that facilitates&nbsp; the implementation of welfare programs for the disadvantaged women, children, families, persons with disabilities, the elderly, victims of disaster, interventions for children in conflict with law (CICL) which would eliminate or minimize the ill-effects of poverty. With regard to the social welfare facilities, services and clientele of Burgos, the MSWDO in 2010 has been helping the residents (222 households) of Brgys. Sapa Grande, Sapa Pequena and Tambacan earn income by extending farm equipment to them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A long term program of cases on Children in Conflict with the Law (CICL), Child Abuse, Domestic Violence were implemented through case study/interventions pursuant to R.A. 9344 or the “Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act of 2006”, R. A. 9262 or the “Anti-Violence Against Women and their Children Act of 2004”, and R.A. 7192 or the “Women in Development and Nation Building”. These programs were extended to selected residents of the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is notable that for the past several years, in terms of the number of clienteles being served by the various social projects of the Local Government Unit thru the MSWDO beneficiaries have increased. This is especially true for the program meant for the senior citizens of Burgos. From 2,582 beneficiaries in 2010, it increased to 2,789 beneficiaries in 2011 and went up again in 2012 with 2,996 beneficiaries. The program meant for persons with disabilities (PWDs) also increased in terms of the number of beneficiaries. From 280 PWDs in 2010 it went up to 288 PWDs in 2011 and 485 PWDs in 2012. The 2012 data on PWD’s in the municipality came from the 2012 survey taken from all the barangays where from the total 98 individuals are hearing challenged, 161 are visually challenged, 41 are speech challenged, 94 have orthopedic disabilities, and 91 have multiple disabilities. The coverage of the program called the “Philhealth <em>parasaMasa</em>” likewise slightly improved in the three year period, 2,238 beneficiaries in 2010, but it went down to 1,648 in 2011 but increased again to 2,479 in 2012. Children who benefitted from the “Early Childhood Care Program – Day Care Services” also increased for the three year period under consideration (2010 to 2012). Included in this program are the daily supplemental feeding (2-day fresh milk with bread and 3-day hot meal) to pre-schoolers were provided.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Electricity is supplied through PANELCO 1 or Pangasinan Electric Cooperative. Of the 4238 households, slightly more than half (54.22%) are electrified. Of the households with electricity, 652 are in urban areas while 1,646 are in the rural barangays primarily because the rural parts are greater in area than the urban and thus contain more households. With respect to the proportions, 99.39% of the urban households are served as compared to the rural households (45.60% of the total rural households served). Thus, a greater proportion (54.10%) of the rural households still does not have electricity.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Most of the connections are domestic (2,107 connections) accounting for 70.12% of the total power consumption. There is only one industrial connection but it already accounts for 15.69% of the electric consumption. Commercial consumers account for 6.88% of the total energy consumption and close behind are the connections in public building where there are 59 connections. With connections almost half of the commercial, the users for public connections almost have the same level of power consumption. Streetlights which are also public connections account for only .58% of total power use.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Potable water is very scarce in the municipality of Burgos. Most of the households still tap into Level 1 water supply system. Level 1 water system comprises of Improved Springs, Deep Wells, and Shallow wells. Of the households having a Level 1 water supply system, more of them get their water from Deep wells. Sapa Pequena has the most proportion (66%) of households sourcing water from deep wells followed by Sapa Grande (52%) of households and San Vicente (41% of households). There are also 11 households who reportedly get water from improved springs.Level 2 water supply consists of pumps and communal faucets. There is only one recorded pump serving the needs of 205 households in barangay Ilio-Ilio.As for the Level 3 waterworks system, there are a total of 368 connections to the local water district. Of these connections, 11 are commercial and 357 are domestic. Average water consumption by the households is 4.6cu.m./month while the commercial users consume an average of 12cu.m/month.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Basic communications technologies are in place in Burgos. Their primary postal service is that which is operated by the government. There are no private firms that provide postal services or even express delivery. The rest of the information and communications technology is provided by the private sector. DIGITEL is the only company offering telephone services although more predominant in usage are the mobile phones. There are three firms that have transmission sites in Burgos. These are Smart, Globe, and Sun Cellular. Internet services are very limited with more of the population depending on household or personal broadband connection.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The municipality operates a controlled open dumpsite located at Barangay San Miguel with an area of 4.495 hectares. The municipal dumpsite has one (1) caretaker in-charge of maintaining the said facility. A 6-wheeler municipal dump truck with a capacity of 15 cubic meter of trash brings in on a daily basis wastes coming from Brgy. Poblacion. The other barangays not serviced by the dump truck does their own composting at their sites. In 2012, the LGU has submitted a Municipal Waste Management Plan to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) for the dumpsite to be accredited by the DENR which will ensure that the dumpsite will follow strict environmental standards. In order to allow easy access to the dumpsite, Dr. ClementinoErmitaño donated a 600 square meter road right of way (RROW) to the LGU.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also located at the dumpsite is a Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) which is around 100 square meters in area. The MRF facility has a bio-reactor and a shredder acquired in 2012. The equipment is still in good condition and is functioning well. The capacity to process garbage on a daily basis for this MRF is half tons of garbage.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The methods of disposal used are composting, segregation,and collection. As of the present time, segregation of waste is done at source. Landfills are used to cover the waste materials brought to the dumpsite. The road leading to the dumpsite is already concreted which can be convenient to use for the dump truck especially during the rainy season.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'Physical/Infrastructure Resources', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '59-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-09-12 11:49:24', '2020-09-12 11:49:24', '', 59, 'https://localhost/git/burgos-website/?p=61', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

This length consists of National roads (12.4 km), Provincial roads (23.42 km), Municipal roads (7.879 km), and Barangay roads (146.684 km). The national road is the Matias- Guiang road. More of the roads are barangay roads (77.05%). The provincial roads comprise 12.30% of the total road network, followed by the national roads at 6.51% and finally the municipal roads at 4.14%.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Most of the provincial and municipal roads have already been concreted (80% of the provincial and 85% for the municipal roads. On the other hand, 96% of the12.4 km stretch of national roads is asphalted. Many of the barangay roads which comprise a greater proportion of the road network are still paved with gravel. 20% of the barangay roads are concrete, 1% is asphalted and 70% is gravel.&nbsp; The remaining 9% of barangay roads remain to be dirt roads.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Municipal Social Welfare and Development Office (MSWDO) is social welfare arm within the Municipality of Burgos that facilitates&nbsp; the implementation of welfare programs for the disadvantaged women, children, families, persons with disabilities, the elderly, victims of disaster, interventions for children in conflict with law (CICL) which would eliminate or minimize the ill-effects of poverty. With regard to the social welfare facilities, services and clientele of Burgos, the MSWDO in 2010 has been helping the residents (222 households) of Brgys. Sapa Grande, Sapa Pequena and Tambacan earn income by extending farm equipment to them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A long term program of cases on Children in Conflict with the Law (CICL), Child Abuse, Domestic Violence were implemented through case study/interventions pursuant to R.A. 9344 or the “Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act of 2006”, R. A. 9262 or the “Anti-Violence Against Women and their Children Act of 2004”, and R.A. 7192 or the “Women in Development and Nation Building”. These programs were extended to selected residents of the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is notable that for the past several years, in terms of the number of clienteles being served by the various social projects of the Local Government Unit thru the MSWDO beneficiaries have increased. This is especially true for the program meant for the senior citizens of Burgos. From 2,582 beneficiaries in 2010, it increased to 2,789 beneficiaries in 2011 and went up again in 2012 with 2,996 beneficiaries. The program meant for persons with disabilities (PWDs) also increased in terms of the number of beneficiaries. From 280 PWDs in 2010 it went up to 288 PWDs in 2011 and 485 PWDs in 2012. The 2012 data on PWD’s in the municipality came from the 2012 survey taken from all the barangays where from the total 98 individuals are hearing challenged, 161 are visually challenged, 41 are speech challenged, 94 have orthopedic disabilities, and 91 have multiple disabilities. The coverage of the program called the “Philhealth <em>parasaMasa</em>” likewise slightly improved in the three year period, 2,238 beneficiaries in 2010, but it went down to 1,648 in 2011 but increased again to 2,479 in 2012. Children who benefitted from the “Early Childhood Care Program – Day Care Services” also increased for the three year period under consideration (2010 to 2012).

Of the 4238 households, slightly more than half (54.22%) are electrified. Of the households with electricity, 652 are in urban areas while 1,646 are in the rural barangays primarily because the rural parts are greater in area than the urban and thus contain more households. With respect to the proportions, 99.39% of the urban households are served as compared to the rural households (45.60% of the total rural households served). Thus, a greater proportion (54.10%) of the rural households still does not have electricity.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Most of the connections are domestic (2,107 connections) accounting for 70.12% of the total power consumption. There is only one industrial connection but it already accounts for 15.69% of the electric consumption. Commercial consumers account for 6.88% of the total energy consumption and close behind are the connections in public building where there are 59 connections. With connections almost half of the commercial, the users for public connections almost have the same level of power consumption. Streetlights which are also public connections account for only .58% of total power use.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Potable water is very scarce in the municipality of Burgos. Most of the households still tap into Level 1 water supply system. Level 1 water system comprises of Improved Springs, Deep Wells, and Shallow wells. Of the households having a Level 1 water supply system, more of them get their water from Deep wells. Sapa Pequena has the most proportion (66%) of households sourcing water from deep wells followed by Sapa Grande (52%) of households and San Vicente (41% of households). There are also 11 households who reportedly get water from improved springs.Level 2 water supply consists of pumps and communal faucets. There is only one recorded pump serving the needs of 205 households in barangay Ilio-Ilio.As for the Level 3 waterworks system, there are a total of 368 connections to the local water district. Of these connections, 11 are commercial and 357 are domestic. Average water consumption by the households is 4.6cu.m./month while the commercial users consume an average of 12cu.m/month.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Basic communications technologies are in place in Burgos. Their primary postal service is that which is operated by the government. There are no private firms that provide postal services or even express delivery. The rest of the information and communications technology is provided by the private sector. DIGITEL is the only company offering telephone services although more predominant in usage are the mobile phones. There are three firms that have transmission sites in Burgos. These are Smart, Globe, and Sun Cellular. Internet services are very limited with more of the population depending on household or personal broadband connection.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The municipality operates a controlled open dumpsite located at Barangay San Miguel with an area of 4.495 hectares. The municipal dumpsite has one (1) caretaker in-charge of maintaining the said facility. A 6-wheeler municipal dump truck with a capacity of 15 cubic meter of trash brings in on a daily basis wastes coming from Brgy. Poblacion. The other barangays not serviced by the dump truck does their own composting at their sites. In 2012, the LGU has submitted a Municipal Waste Management Plan to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) for the dumpsite to be accredited by the DENR which will ensure that the dumpsite will follow strict environmental standards. In order to allow easy access to the dumpsite, Dr. ClementinoErmitaño donated a 600 square meter road right of way (RROW) to the LGU.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also located at the dumpsite is a Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) which is around 100 square meters in area. The MRF facility has a bio-reactor and a shredder acquired in 2012. The equipment is still in good condition and is functioning well. The capacity to process garbage on a daily basis for this MRF is half tons of garbage.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The methods of disposal used are composting, segregation,and collection. As of the present time, segregation of waste is done at source. Landfills are used to cover the waste materials brought to the dumpsite. The road leading to the dumpsite is already concreted which can be convenient to use for the dump truck especially during the rainy season.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'Physical / Infrastructure Resources', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '59-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-09-12 14:04:45', '2020-09-12 14:04:45', '', 59, 'https://localhost/git/burgos-website/?p=91', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The central portion of the municipality is identified as a highly restricted agricultural area (HRAA). Thus Burgos is basically designated as an agricultural municipality making vital contributions to the agricultural and industrial development of the province. The PPFP does not mention any particular industries that can be the focus of development in the municipality. Forest lands for preservation are identified in the northernmost part while also mentioning the mangrove areas of Burgos. Reforestation, low susceptibility to landslides and flooding are noted. Among the concerns identified in the municipality are the need for socialized housing in view of its informal settlers, the need for a health service and water and sanitary facilities.&nbsp; The national road passing through Burgos is seen as an important factor that may affect development in the municipality. In like manner, the provincial road to Ilio-Ilio has been earmarked for conversion as national road. The proposed Dasol-Burgos-Agno-Bani-Bolinao coastal road has also been identified as a major intervention in the municipality. Mapped under the PPFP, Burgos is visualized basically for production land use with grazing, pasture and agricultural lands. In line with all these, the municipality of Burgos should be developed as an agricultural municipality able to provide support for the other urban centers of the province given its strategic location.</p></li>\n<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>1.2.

The upgrading of the existing commercial business district and the public market should be prioritized extending to stretches along the national highway. A satellite commercial district in the other end of the municipality should be developed.These commercial support facilities shall serve asalternative growth centers. The commercial focus of the municipality shall be further enhanced by marketing its central position to the other surrounding municipalities in the province.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>- Expansion of communication and transportation services</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The local government shall continue in efforts to establish moderntransportation and communication facilities and services tosupport economic revitalization.&nbsp; In order to speed up profitable economic transactions, the municipality shall provide for these facilities highlighting its connectivity with other municipalities. An area also targeted for expansion is the avenue of Internet access for all capable residents in order for them to be linked to the global information technology net. Transport activities along the major roads shall also be expanded.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>- Identification and advancement of tourism potentials</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Tourism shall be included in the thrusts of the municipality focused in its coastal areas.&nbsp; The tourism potentials of the municipality shall be roused by way of presenting the rural character of Burgos showcased along the major road network and connected to the coastal tourist attraction.&nbsp; Support facilities and activities shall be planned for and developed through specific tourism objectives on the coastal barangay radiating to adjacent barangays.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>- Promotion of Environmental Protection</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The maintenance of the natural resources of the municipality shall fostered by emphasizing scenic tourism and protection. Environmental protection programs shall be designed especially in the management of the limited forest resources of the municipality while keeping in mind the agricultural thrusts of the municipality.

Alternative 1: Agro-commercial development strategy (Natural Growth Pattern)</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Agricultural growth coupled with commercialization is already the trend in the municipality that coincides with what may be seen as the natural growth pattern that intends to followpast trends.&nbsp; The plan involves letting the urban area and other population centers develop following their natural tendency.&nbsp; Minimal local government intervention is required in implementing this type of development.The primary interventions shall be in protecting prime agricultural areas and providing agricultural support facilities and services. This shall be combined with efforts to increase access to markets through commercialization. Following the natural growth pattern, services and opportunities shall be concentrated in the barangays of the Poblacion and other areas such as the barangay of Pogoruac. Settlements and their support activities shall be developed along the existing major transportation and communication routes. (See Map No. 3, Natural Growth Pattern Map). Maintenance and upgrading of these primary routes shall be done to ensure mobility and to enhance accessibility.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The advantage of this form of development is the decongestion of the sole urban barangay of Burgos. It also means maximizing the use of the major road trunk line.&nbsp; In the long run however, this development plan tends to result in land use patterns that undermine the feasibility and opportunity of designing urban development in potential expansion areas.&nbsp; At the same time, it accelerates the conversion of prime agricultural areas from which the residents derive their daily sustenance. Thus the long-term effect negates the initial advantages gained.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>2.2. Alternative 2: Rapid Commercio-Industrialization Strategy (Classic Stellar or Constellation Pattern)</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Still connected with the first alternative, this second development thrusts includes industrialization as a partner of commercialization. This strategy would require the putting up of support services, facilities and utilities that shall support industrial activities.&nbsp; This strategy takes advantage of the agri-business and agri-industrial potentials of the municipality to complement the agricultural sector. Intensified commercialization shall take the form of providing trading centers (primarily for livestock) highlighting the envisioned roleof the municipality as a livestock provider for the whole province. Industrial and commercial facilities shall be used to attract investments into the municipality.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>This kind of development sees a spatial strategy corresponding to the Classic Stellar or Constellation Model which is based on Hoyt’stheory that urban growth and development tends to follow major transportation and communications routes radiating away from the urban core. Such a development aided by government regulation and intervention assumes the shape of a starfish whose limbs symbolize the radiating arms of development. Applied to Burgos, the Poblacion is to be targeted as the center of &nbsp;development. Growth impetus is expected to spread outwards to the peripheral barangays along the major trunk lines. The concept, therefore, approximates a regulated form of the natural growth model but is also is be-saddled by that model’s negative collateral consequences.The main limitation of this model is that it makes no reference to out of town development.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>This model takes into account the observation that it is common for households to be near road lines, and commercial establishments to be along business thoroughfares. Recognizing that the various transportation routes into an urban area represented greater access, cities tended to grow in wedge-shaped patterns -- or sectors -- emanating from the central business district and centered on major transportation routes. Higher levels of access meant higher land values, thus, many commercial functions would remain in the central business district (the Poblacion) but manufacturing functions would develop in a wedge surrounding transportation routes. Residential functions would grow in wedge-shaped patterns.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Map No. 4, Classic Stellar Map, illustrates the Classic Stellar or Constellation model for Burgos.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>3.

The structure plan, on the other hand is described as the <strong><em>Multi-Point Scenic Agricultural Development Model</em></strong>. The strategic plan makes a case for the preservation of the agricultural character of Burgos arguing that the municipality may be developed as a showcase agricultural community supported by agriculture-based commerce and industry, facilitated by its connectivity to other areas within the province via the road network, and guided by an aspiration to preserve its agricultural character.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>This development plan lends a strong support for economic development that retains Burgos’ agricultural character and protects its important natural resources and pristine environment. Development in Burgos should maintain the quality of life of its people provided by a landscape dominated by farming, resource preservation, scenic areas and many opportunities for outdoor activities, while supporting the harvesting of agricultural products and other land based economic development. In keeping with this image, traditional economic growth should be encouraged in areas where infrastructure already exists or may be easily extended in order to minimize environmental degradation and haphazard transformation of the municipality’s character.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The said strategy is depicted in the following diagramand presented in the Structure/Concept Plan Map (See Map No. 5 and figure 3).</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The diagram illustrates the preferred land use strategy of Burgos which tries to embody the harmony between agriculture-led development and the preservation of the agricultural town character of Burgos, hence the notion of&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>“<em>scenic agricultural development</em>.”</strong> While economic development via agriculture is the goal, the strategy aims to achieve this goal together with proper management of land uses that preserves the countryside character of the municipality. This is done, as shown in the diagram, through the interplay of three main “<strong><em>land use development blocks”</em></strong>or areasin the municipality, namely: (1) the commercial blocks, (2) agricultural blocks and (3) scenic blocks. Land uses in these areas are to be guided by the characteristics sought to be preserved in these blocks as described below. Zoning is thus understood in its ecological sense of designating areas with a distinct or characteristic system determined largely by its environment. Designated by translucent areas in the diagram (red for commercial blocks, green for agricultural blocks and light green scenic blocks), these blocks signify how artificial boundaries in the municipality’s land uses are transcended through the integration of space.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>In order to orchestrate development in these blocks, the model calls for the designation of components of a system that may be designated as specific points of intervention or as the designated components of a multi-point approach resting on the identification of strategic barangays in the municipality. Instead of concentrating on one or two barangays as points of development, the model advocates systematically distributing development efforts in several barangays or “<strong><em>multi-points of growth</em></strong>.”&nbsp; Designated as growth points, these points are identified to provide the impetus for development in agriculture and agro-forestry, commerce and industry, and tourism. Encouraging economic activities in these multiple points will help reduce the likelihood of haphazard strip development along existing roads which may, above all, work to destroy the agricultural character of the municipality.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:table --></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\">\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Figure 3&nbsp;&nbsp; : MULTI-POINT SCENIC AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT MODEL</strong><strong></strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong></strong> Scenic Blocks (Forest/Pasture) Agri-Commercial Point (Poblacion&amp; Adjacent barangays) Agri-ScenicPoints (Concordia-Sapa Grande- Sapa Pequena) &nbsp; Agricultural Blocks (Farmlands) Agri-Forest &amp;Mariculture Points (Ilio-ilio &amp; Cacayasen) Agri-TourismPoint (Cabongaoan Beach, Ilio-ilio) Commercial &amp; Industrial Blocks &nbsp; &nbsp; Potential Coastal Road Agri-Industrial Point (Pogoruac/Papallasen)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</figure>\n<p><!-- /wp:table --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>a. The Land Use Development Blocks</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>This strategy takes-off from the observation that Burgos has acquired an agricultural character through development that has kept large portions of the municipality in unsullied conditions. This plan focuses on amplifying and riding on this characteristic which can be presented as the specific difference Burgos. The rural agricultural character of Burgos exists due to the scenic vistas, large uninterrupted farmlands and pasturelands, forested areas, and limited and scattered development along the roads. This agricultural character should be of importance in planning for the municipality.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The agricultural character of Burgos may be evaluated from three perspectives represented by the three land-use-development-blocks- (1) the scenic blocks, (2) the agricultural block, and (3) the commercial blocks.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Scenic Block</em>s</strong> are conceived from the vantage point of the road connecting the Poblacion to Ilio-ilio. The scenic blocks are to be characterized by views of fairly open areas adjacent to farmlands. More distant views of forested ridgelines shall also be highlighted. The several large farms along the road network shall add to the scenic agricultural character of the municipality. Scattered single family dwellings, some newer and some historic, located along the roadshall be kept. These views should be consciously protected in planning. The municipal protected areas should therefore include those areas within the forestry, pastureland and farmlands.&nbsp; Proper planning and zoning should allow the protection of these areas without limiting economic development through conservation easements. Basically, this should mean that the scenic views will be afforded some level of protection from indiscriminate development. It should be noted that many of the unprotected areas in Burgos are open fields and farms where future development would be highly visible. Development along the roads needs to preserve the open fields and farms and provide a visual and functional relationship of structures to the surrounding landscape. Development guidelines should be established to help protect the open fields along the scenic views from the road while still allowing controlled development.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Commercial / Industrial Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the Poblacion and the national road network passing through the Poblacion which connotes a well-defined route along Burgos to the other municipalities in Western Pangasinan and the sites of agri-industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen. Thesecommercial areasareto be characterizedby mix of land uses with planned pockets of commercial areas, particularly in the Poblacion immediately adjacent barangays. The compact development of the Poblacion with its defined entry points and the fact that itserves as a center for local commercial and institutional activities defines its agricultural and commercial character. The sites of the industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be presented as areas for investments in industrial ventures. Development guidelines should allow and encourage the continuation of the village-style development in this area. Despite the commercialization to be allowed, economic development that promotes the viability of the working landscape should be designed along with forestry and agriculture-related enterprises that preserve the character of Burgos.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agricultural Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the productive agricultural lands in the Poblacion to San Vicente and San Miguel areas, as well as the agricultural areas in the western barangays of the municipality. The goal should be to stimulate appropriate economic development and provide opportunity for individuals to establish agriculture-based ventures in these areas. Economic development in the different barangays should reinforce traditional settlement patterns, protect the agricultural character of the municipality and revitalize village and growth centers. This plan therefore declares that the best interest of Burgos is to see to it that new development occurs in amanner that does not change the basic land use patterns, and consequently the character of Burgos. Therefore, the multiple points identified to function as growth centers below should be the focus for mixed-use, higher intensity development and new growth.&nbsp; Outlying areas should be designed and managed so as not to compromise the agricultural character of Burgos or its important natural resources.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>b. The Multi-Points of Growth</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The identified growth points are: (1) the Agri-Commercial points (i.e., the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac), (2) the Agri-InustriaLpoints (the barangays of PogoruacandPapallasen), (3) the Agri-Forest Mariculture points (i.e., the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen), (4) the Agri-Scenic points (i.e., the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena), and (5) the Agri-Tourism point (i.e., Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio). Calling these growth points by names prefixed by “agriculture” (i.e., Agri) emphasizes the role that agriculture is supposed to play in shaping the development of Burgos in combination with&nbsp; commerce and industry, fishing and aquaculture, tourism, and scenic management of the farmlands, forests and pasturelands.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The model advises that development interventions should be concentrated in these growth points while eventually seeing their effects on the other barangays. By deliberately planning changes in these growth points, harmonious changes in the three land-use-development-blocks are sought. Thus, the growth points are expected to generate further growth in surrounding barangays. The strategy aims to develop growth points as the foci for intervention.&nbsp; Apart from helping de-concentrate development away from the traditional centers, it is also designed to create new catchments for dispersing industry, commerce and people.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Commercial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate commercial activities by inducing entrepreneurs and investors to put up commercial shops and outlets in the Poblacion’s central business district and Pogoruac as the alternative commercial growth center in the opposite end of the municipality.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Industrial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate industrial activities primarily stemming from the invitation for industrial venture investments in two industrial hubs in the two said barangays.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Forest Mariculture Points</em></strong> are set in the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen. Both Ilio-ilo and Cacayasen are the sites forests areas Burgos. With the aim of expanding the protected forests in the municipality, these two barangays shall be the centers of forest management efforts.&nbsp; Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen are also the sites of substantial fishing activities. The coastal Ilio-ilio produces marine catch for local consumption while Cacayasen, with its fishponds is strategically the most favorable area for aquaculture since it is a low lying area where water is retained in natural and artificial ponds. This inherent geographical characteristic of the barangay which may render it non-conducive to farming and raising livestock warrants planning to developing it as a zone for aquaculture.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Scenic Points</em></strong> shall be the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena. Spatially, these three barangays form a belt which is transected by the road network. These three barangays, will serve as sections of the municipality’s transportation and utility corridor. Planning in these barangays should maximize productive land use without severing farm units while facilitating access for producers and harvesters. Guided by the goal of preserving the scenic stretches along the route, every effort should be made to avoid impairment of agricultural lands as well as the pasturelands. Proper planning in these barangays will ensure that the transportation and utility corridor will be managed carefully in the context of the agricultural lands and uses through which it passes. The transportation facilities should complement and serve, rather than harm the municipality’s farmlands, pastureland and agriculture industry through which they pass.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Tourism Point</em></strong> is the Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio. Cabongaoan shall serve as the end-point of a tourism destination which should include the whole of the municipality- branded as “scenic agricultural tourism.” This tourism concept is based on the design that the municipality can be presented as an agricultural community with distinct assets. Visitors can come in search of peaceful relaxation, inspiration, recreation, education and entertainment. Among the tourism assets of Burgos which can be the content of its marketing efforts should be its small town atmosphere, scenery, agricultural tourism, outdoor recreation, festivals and events, and&nbsp; environmental wonders culminating in its clean beach and coast&nbsp; in Cabongaoan.&nbsp; Thus, tourism in Burgos becomes not just an isolated activity in Cabongaoan but a municipality-wide promotion. Cabongaoan should be planned as the final destination at the end of the scenic corridor passing through the agricultural and scenic blocks of the municipality and as destination along the proposed coastal road of the province.&nbsp; To be effective, Cabongaoan should unify Burgos’ agricultural and rural community with beach tourism where functional and emotional benefits will be open to visitors. The whole of Burgos should therefore be considered as tourist destination and not only its beach.<strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n</ul>', 'THE CONCEPT / STRUCTURE PLAN', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'the-concept-structure-plan', '', '', '2020-09-14 11:06:56', '2020-09-14 11:06:56', '', 98, 'https://localhost/git/burgos-website/?page_id=109', 0, 'page', '', 0),

PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.1.&nbsp; Functional Role of the Municipality</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The municipality of Burgos is recognized as an agricultural and agro-industrial municipality.&nbsp; The Provincial Physical Framework Plan (PPFP) of the Province of Pangasinan classifies Burgos as a satellite growth center, being connected to surrounding municipalities. The central portion of the municipality is identified as a highly restricted agricultural area (HRAA). Thus Burgos is basically designated as an agricultural municipality making vital contributions to the agricultural and industrial development of the province. The PPFP does not mention any particular industries that can be the focus of development in the municipality. Forest lands for preservation are identified in the northernmost part while also mentioning the mangrove areas of Burgos. Reforestation, low susceptibility to landslides and flooding are noted. Among the concerns identified in the municipality are the need for socialized housing in view of its informal settlers, the need for a health service and water and sanitary facilities.&nbsp; The national road passing through Burgos is seen as an important factor that may affect development in the municipality. In like manner, the provincial road to Ilio-Ilio has been earmarked for conversion as national road. The proposed Dasol-Burgos-Agno-Bani-Bolinao coastal road has also been identified as a major intervention in the municipality. Mapped under the PPFP, Burgos is visualized basically for production land use with grazing, pasture and agricultural lands. In line with all these, the municipality of Burgos should be developed as an agricultural municipalityable to provide support for the other urban centers of the province given its strategic location.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.2. Settlement Type</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Burgos is considered in the Provincial Physical Framework Plan as a 4<sup>th</sup> &nbsp;class municipality.

Population</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It has been projected that the municipality’s population will increase to 20,995 people by 2022. This population increase demands that the municipality provides more infrastructure facilities and services to address population demands.&nbsp; Apart from that, the provision of the needed land requirement to accommodate the population surplus as well as the observed informal settlements should be taken into account.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.4.

Alternative 1: Agro-commercial development strategy (Natural Growth Pattern)</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Agricultural growth coupled with commercialization is already the trend in the municipality that coincides with what may be seen as the natural growth pattern that intends to followpast trends.&nbsp; The plan involves letting the urban area and other population centers develop following their natural tendency.&nbsp; Minimal local government intervention is required in implementing this type of development.The primary interventions shall be in protecting prime agricultural areas and providing agricultural support facilities and services. This shall be combined with efforts to increase access to markets through commercialization. Following the natural growth pattern, services and opportunities shall be concentrated in the barangays of the Poblacion and other areas such as the barangay of Pogoruac. Settlements and their support activities shall be developed along the existing major transportation and communication routes. (See Map No. 3, Natural Growth Pattern Map). Maintenance and upgrading of these primary routes shall be done to ensure mobility and to enhance accessibility.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The advantage of this form of development is the decongestion of the sole urban barangay of Burgos. It also means maximizing the use of the major road trunk line.&nbsp; In the long run however, this development plan tends to result in land use patterns that undermine the feasibility and opportunity of designing urban development in potential expansion areas.&nbsp; At the same time, it accelerates the conversion of prime agricultural areas from which the residents derive their daily sustenance. Thus the long-term effect negates the initial advantages gained.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>2.2. Alternative 2: Rapid Commercio-Industrialization Strategy (Classic Stellar or Constellation Pattern)</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Still connected with the first alternative, this second development thrusts includes industrialization as a partner of commercialization. This strategy would require the putting up of support services, facilities and utilities that shall support industrial activities.&nbsp; This strategy takes advantage of the agri-business and agri-industrial potentials of the municipality to complement the agricultural sector. Intensified commercialization shall take the form of providing trading centers (primarily for livestock) highlighting the envisioned roleof the municipality as a livestock provider for the whole province. Industrial and commercial facilities shall be used to attract investments into the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This kind of development sees a spatial strategy corresponding to the Classic Stellar or Constellation Model which is based on Hoyt’stheory that urban growth and development tends to follow major transportation and communications routes radiating away from the urban core. Such a development aided by government regulation and intervention assumes the shape of a starfish whose limbs symbolize the radiating arms of development. Applied to Burgos, the Poblacion is to be targeted as the center of &nbsp;development. Growth impetus is expected to spread outwards to the peripheral barangays along the major trunk lines. The concept, therefore, approximates a regulated form of the natural growth model but is also is be-saddled by that model’s negative collateral consequences.The main limitation of this model is that it makes no reference to out of town development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This model takes into account the observation that it is common for households to be near road lines, and commercial establishments to be along business thoroughfares. Recognizing that the various transportation routes into an urban area represented greater access, cities tended to grow in wedge-shaped patterns -- or sectors -- emanating from the central business district and centered on major transportation routes. Higher levels of access meant higher land values, thus, many commercial functions would remain in the central business district (the Poblacion) but manufacturing functions would develop in a wedge surrounding transportation routes. Residential functions would grow in wedge-shaped patterns.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Map No. 4, Classic Stellar Map, illustrates the Classic Stellar or Constellation model for Burgos.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3. THE STRUCTURE PLAN</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The definitive development thrust chosen for Burgos has been guided, to a large extent, by the municipality’s formulated vision and mission which, in turn, shaped the goals and strategies formulated from the different sectoral studies. Thus, the &nbsp;Goals Achievement Matrix (GAM) was the main tool used in analyzing the different alternatives development thrusts for the municipality.

Land as Location</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This concept considers the factor of land as a point in space wherein relative distance to other locations of different variables in spaces is studied.&nbsp; Location is a major factor affecting the value and uses of land.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>c. Land as Property</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This concept considers the ownership rights of individuals and/or groups.&nbsp; Within the context of the development proposals, the ownership right to use land as property is subjected to the regulations of the state for the purposes of general welfare and the optimum and efficient use of land as a resource.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3.1.2. Concepts and Principles in Land Use Planning</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>a. High/Best/Optimum Use</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Land is considered at its highest and optimum use when its use is for the purpose or combination of purposes, and in which it has the highest comparative advantage, or the least comparative disadvantage relative to other uses.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>b. Compatible Use</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A land use is considered compatible of said use if it could be in harmony with uses of land adjacent to the subject land use and/or to the dominant land use within the vicinity of subject land use.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>c. Land as limited fixed resource and as such must be managed for the welfare, and in accordance to the community’s operation as reflected in their development plan.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>d. The environment provides man with life supporting system and as such it shall be conserved and developed to enhance the quality of life.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>e. Land must be used in the most beneficial, rational and most efficient manner so as to prevent the mixture of incompatible uses, environmental hazards, slight depletion and degradation of land resources.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>f. There is a need for regulatory measures to promote the desired pattern of land use as proposed in this Comprehensive Land Use Plan.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>g. The concept of Hierarchy of Settlements</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Settlements naturally develop in varying degrees could be categorized into a hierarchical order of functions.&nbsp; Said natural development trends could, however be altered by planning efforts to effect the desired and efficient distribution of the hierarchical order of functions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>h. Growth Center Strategy</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This physical development strategy considers the situation with limited resources and the possible situation of such limited resources not efficiently distributed in land as space.&nbsp; Due to this situation, levels and types of growth centers are identified and located equitably as focal delivery points for specific types of services, facilities and resource opportunities to serve the designated influence area in an efficient manner.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>i. Concentric Development</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This physical development strategy takes into consideration the dispersal of activities within an urban core or center by expanding on the areas contiguous to, or adjacent to and beyond that core.&nbsp; The immediate and outer peripheries of the urban core are identified as the expansion area of urban growth and development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>j. Linear or Strip Development</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This physical development strategy follows trends that urban development form along major routes or trunk lines for transportation and communication.&nbsp; It is aimed to develop new hubs of economic activities along the major routes to disperse effects to its outlying areas.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>k. Central and Nodal Development</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This development concept follows a certain hierarchy of functions and sizes.&nbsp; The central point of activity is focused on the identified major growth center supported by growth nodes around it. It is assumed that the major growth center shall provide specialized facilities and services, which shall trickle out to the growth nodes.&nbsp; It also serves as the external link of the municipality to other municipalities and cities.&nbsp; The nodes, on the other hand, provide support to the major growth center as its captive market of both labor and resources, and at the same time disperse development services to its influence areas.&nbsp; An efficient circulation system is required to achieve complementarity of the major growth center and the nodes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3.2.&nbsp; Structure Plan</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The following structure plan is based on the preferred development strategy of Burgos described as<strong><em>agro-commercio-industrial &amp;agri-tourism management strategy</em></strong>. The structure plan, on the other hand is described as the <strong><em>Multi-Point Scenic Agricultural Development Model</em></strong>. The strategic plan makes a case for the preservation of the agricultural character of Burgos arguing that the municipality may be developed as a showcase agricultural community supported by agriculture-based commerce and industry, facilitated by its connectivity to other areas within the province via the road network, and guided by an aspiration to preserve its agricultural character.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This development plan lends a strong support for economic development that retains Burgos’ agricultural character and protects its important natural resources and pristine environment. Development in Burgos should maintain the quality of life of its people provided by a landscape dominated by farming, resource preservation, scenic areas and many opportunities for outdoor activities, while supporting the harvesting of agricultural products and other land based economic development. In keeping with this image, traditional economic growth should be encouraged in areas where infrastructure already exists or may be easily extended in order to minimize environmental degradation and haphazard transformation of the municipality’s character.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The said strategy is depicted in the following diagramand presented in the Structure/Concept Plan Map (See Map No. 5 and figure 3).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The diagram illustrates the preferred land use strategy of Burgos which tries to embody the harmony between agriculture-led development and the preservation of the agricultural town character of Burgos, hence the notion of&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>“<em>scenic agricultural development</em>.”</strong> While economic development via agriculture is the goal, the strategy aims to achieve this goal together with proper management of land uses that preserves the countryside character of the municipality. This is done, as shown in the diagram, through the interplay of three main “<strong><em>land use development blocks”</em></strong>or areasin the municipality, namely: (1) the commercial blocks, (2) agricultural blocks and (3) scenic blocks. Land uses in these areas are to be guided by the characteristics sought to be preserved in these blocks as described below. Zoning is thus understood in its ecological sense of designating areas with a distinct or characteristic system determined largely by its environment. Designated by translucent areas in the diagram (red for commercial blocks, green for agricultural blocks and light green scenic blocks), these blocks signify how artificial boundaries in the municipality’s land uses are transcended through the integration of space.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In order to orchestrate development in these blocks, the model calls for the designation of components of a system that may be designated as specific points of intervention or as the designated components of a multi-point approach resting on the identification of strategic barangays in the municipality. Instead of concentrating on one or two barangays as points of development, the model advocates systematically distributing development efforts in several barangays or “<strong><em>multi-points of growth</em></strong>.”&nbsp; Designated as growth points, these points are identified to provide the impetus for development in agriculture and agro-forestry, commerce and industry, and tourism. Encouraging economic activities in these multiple points will help reduce the likelihood of haphazard strip development along existing roads which may, above all, work to destroy the agricultural character of the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:table -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Figure 3&nbsp;&nbsp; : MULTI-POINT SCENIC AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT MODEL</strong><strong></strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong></strong> Scenic Blocks (Forest/Pasture) Agri-Commercial Point (Poblacion&amp; Adjacent barangays) Agri-ScenicPoints (Concordia-Sapa Grande- Sapa Pequena) &nbsp; Agricultural Blocks (Farmlands) Agri-Forest &amp;Mariculture Points (Ilio-ilio &amp; Cacayasen) Agri-TourismPoint (Cabongaoan Beach, Ilio-ilio) Commercial &amp; Industrial Blocks &nbsp; &nbsp; Potential Coastal Road Agri-Industrial Point (Pogoruac/Papallasen)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n<!-- /wp:table -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>a. The Land Use Development Blocks</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This strategy takes-off from the observation that Burgos has acquired an agricultural character through development that has kept large portions of the municipality in unsullied conditions. This plan focuses on amplifying and riding on this characteristic which can be presented as the specific difference Burgos. The rural agricultural character of Burgos exists due to the scenic vistas, large uninterrupted farmlands and pasturelands, forested areas, and limited and scattered development along the roads. This agricultural character should be of importance in planning for the municipality.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The agricultural character of Burgos may be evaluated from three perspectives represented by the three land-use-development-blocks- (1) the scenic blocks, (2) the agricultural block, and (3) the commercial blocks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Scenic Block</em>s</strong> are conceived from the vantage point of the road connecting the Poblacion to Ilio-ilio. The scenic blocks are to be characterized by views of fairly open areas adjacent to farmlands. More distant views of forested ridgelines shall also be highlighted. The several large farms along the road network shall add to the scenic agricultural character of the municipality. Scattered single family dwellings, some newer and some historic, located along the roadshall be kept. These views should be consciously protected in planning. The municipal protected areas should therefore include those areas within the forestry, pastureland and farmlands.&nbsp; Proper planning and zoning should allow the protection of these areas without limiting economic development through conservation easements. Basically, this should mean that the scenic views will be afforded some level of protection from indiscriminate development. It should be noted that many of the unprotected areas in Burgos are open fields and farms where future development would be highly visible. Development along the roads needs to preserve the open fields and farms and provide a visual and functional relationship of structures to the surrounding landscape. Development guidelines should be established to help protect the open fields along the scenic views from the road while still allowing controlled development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Commercial / Industrial Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the Poblacion and the national road network passing through the Poblacion which connotes a well-defined route along Burgos to the other municipalities in Western Pangasinan and the sites of agri-industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen. Thesecommercial areasareto be characterizedby mix of land uses with planned pockets of commercial areas, particularly in the Poblacion immediately adjacent barangays. The compact development of the Poblacion with its defined entry points and the fact that itserves as a center for local commercial and institutional activities defines its agricultural and commercial character. The sites of the industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be presented as areas for investments in industrial ventures. Development guidelines should allow and encourage the continuation of the village-style development in this area. Despite the commercialization to be allowed, economic development that promotes the viability of the working landscape should be designed along with forestry and agriculture-related enterprises that preserve the character of Burgos.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agricultural Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the productive agricultural lands in the Poblacion to San Vicente and San Miguel areas, as well as the agricultural areas in the western barangays of the municipality. The goal should be to stimulate appropriate economic development and provide opportunity for individuals to establish agriculture-based ventures in these areas. Economic development in the different barangays should reinforce traditional settlement patterns, protect the agricultural character of the municipality and revitalize village and growth centers. This plan therefore declares that the best interest of Burgos is to see to it that new development occurs in amanner that does not change the basic land use patterns, and consequently the character of Burgos. Therefore, the multiple points identified to function as growth centers below should be the focus for mixed-use, higher intensity development and new growth.&nbsp; Outlying areas should be designed and managed so as not to compromise the agricultural character of Burgos or its important natural resources.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>b. The Multi-Points of Growth</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The identified growth points are: (1) the Agri-Commercial points (i.e., the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac), (2) the Agri-InustriaLpoints (the barangays of PogoruacandPapallasen), (3) the Agri-Forest Mariculture points (i.e., the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen), (4) the Agri-Scenic points (i.e., the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena), and (5) the Agri-Tourism point (i.e., Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio). Calling these growth points by names prefixed by “agriculture” (i.e., Agri) emphasizes the role that agriculture is supposed to play in shaping the development of Burgos in combination with&nbsp; commerce and industry, fishing and aquaculture, tourism, and scenic management of the farmlands, forests and pasturelands.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The model advises that development interventions should be concentrated in these growth points while eventually seeing their effects on the other barangays. By deliberately planning changes in these growth points, harmonious changes in the three land-use-development-blocks are sought. Thus, the growth points are expected to generate further growth in surrounding barangays. The strategy aims to develop growth points as the foci for intervention.&nbsp; Apart from helping de-concentrate development away from the traditional centers, it is also designed to create new catchments for dispersing industry, commerce and people.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Commercial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate commercial activities by inducing entrepreneurs and investors to put up commercial shops and outlets in the Poblacion’s central business district and Pogoruac as the alternative commercial growth center in the opposite end of the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Industrial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate industrial activities primarily stemming from the invitation for industrial venture investments in two industrial hubs in the two said barangays.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Forest Mariculture Points</em></strong> are set in the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen. Both Ilio-ilo and Cacayasen are the sites forests areas Burgos. With the aim of expanding the protected forests in the municipality, these two barangays shall be the centers of forest management efforts.&nbsp; Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen are also the sites of substantial fishing activities. The coastal Ilio-ilio produces marine catch for local consumption while Cacayasen, with its fishponds is strategically the most favorable area for aquaculture since it is a low lying area where water is retained in natural and artificial ponds. This inherent geographical characteristic of the barangay which may render it non-conducive to farming and raising livestock warrants planning to developing it as a zone for aquaculture.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Scenic Points</em></strong> shall be the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena. Spatially, these three barangays form a belt which is transected by the road network. These three barangays, will serve as sections of the municipality’s transportation and utility corridor. Planning in these barangays should maximize productive land use without severing farm units while facilitating access for producers and harvesters. Guided by the goal of preserving the scenic stretches along the route, every effort should be made to avoid impairment of agricultural lands as well as the pasturelands. Proper planning in these barangays will ensure that the transportation and utility corridor will be managed carefully in the context of the agricultural lands and uses through which it passes. The transportation facilities should complement and serve, rather than harm the municipality’s farmlands, pastureland and agriculture industry through which they pass.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Tourism Point</em></strong> is the Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio. Cabongaoan shall serve as the end-point of a tourism destination which should include the whole of the municipality- branded as “scenic agricultural tourism.” This tourism concept is based on the design that the municipality can be presented as an agricultural community with distinct assets. Visitors can come in search of peaceful relaxation, inspiration, recreation, education and entertainment. Among the tourism assets of Burgos which can be the content of its marketing efforts should be its small town atmosphere, scenery, agricultural tourism, outdoor recreation, festivals and events, and&nbsp; environmental wonders culminating in its clean beach and coast&nbsp; in Cabongaoan.&nbsp; Thus, tourism in Burgos becomes not just an isolated activity in Cabongaoan but a municipality-wide promotion. Cabongaoan should be planned as the final destination at the end of the scenic corridor passing through the agricultural and scenic blocks of the municipality and as destination along the proposed coastal road of the province.&nbsp; To be effective, Cabongaoan should unify Burgos’ agricultural and rural community with beach tourism where functional and emotional benefits will be open to visitors. The whole of Burgos should therefore be considered as tourist destination and not only its beach.<strong><br></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'THE CONCEPT / STRUCTURE PLAN', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '109-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-09-13 09:49:42', '2020-09-13 09:49:42', '', 109, 'https://localhost/git/burgos-website/?p=110', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

At the same time, more areas are sought to be placed under municipal protection including farmlands, forest lands and some pasturelands.&nbsp; The ease by which lands can be made to remain in their previous classifications highlights the fact that the maximization of the use of underutilized land presents Burgos with great opportunities.

As argued earlier, development in Burgos should maintain the quality of life of its people provided by a landscape dominated by farming, resource preservation, scenic areas and many opportunities for outdoor activities, while supporting the harvesting of agricultural products and other land based economic development.

At the same time, more areas are sought to be placed under municipal protection including farmlands, forest lands and some pasturelands.&nbsp; The ease by which lands can be made to remain in their previous classifications highlights the fact that the maximization of the use of underutilized land presents Burgos with great opportunities.

As argued earlier, development in Burgos should maintain the quality of life of its people provided by a landscape dominated by farming, resource preservation, scenic areas and many opportunities for outdoor activities, while supporting the harvesting of agricultural products and other land based economic development. Traditional economic growth should be encouraged in areas where infrastructure already exists or may be easily extended in order to minimize environmental degradation and haphazard transformation of the municipality’s character.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The available land supply for development and future expansion areas in Burgos is computed at 2,880.3198 hectares representing the area within the municipality available for urban use expansion. This area represents&nbsp; the land available after deducting the areas considered for protection or preservation and conservation such as the SAFDZ and protected forests (PCA), existing urban areas (UA) and special land use (SLU) areas from the total land area (TLA) of the municipality. The estimated total land area needed for urban development and other special planning areas based on the previous sectoral studies goes up to around 24 hectares which requires some reclassification basically ofagro-forest/pasturelands in the different barangays and open spaces in the urban barangays, as discussed below.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Since the goal of the preferred development strategy for Burgos is the preservation of its agricultural character amidst planned growth and development, efforts have been placed in ensuring that no substantial changes in the areas devoted for the different land uses are proposed. Instead, focus is placed on the efforts to maximize the use of idle and underutilized lands especially in agriculture, agro-industrial and commercial sectors. At the same time, more areas are sought to be placed under municipal protection including farmlands, forest lands and some pasturelands.&nbsp; The ease by which lands can be made to remain in their previous classifications highlights the fact that the maximization of the use of underutilized land presents Burgos with great opportunities. Potentials for growth and development may be maximized while still retaining the pristine environment of the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This Land Use Plan shall aid in optimizing the use of both public and private lands, and in resolving land use issues.&nbsp; It shall function as aguide in prescribing the use and re-use of land, and in molding the physical, social and economic trend of development of the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.

To be connected with the Poblacion’s development is the development of its immediately adjacent barangays. The spatial design shall provide for flexibility in allowable uses to promote and support a dynamic interaction between the producing and consuming sectors of the municipality. The urban area of the municipality will not expand and will remain at 143.6391 hectares, representing 1.19% of the total municipal land area.&nbsp; The resulting functional land uses are discussed below and quantities are tabulated in Table No. 3, Existing and Proposed Land Uses, Urban and Figure No. 4, Comparative Proposed Urban Land Uses).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Functional Land Uses in the Urban Area</em></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>1.1.Residential Use / Residential Subdivision</em></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is characterized by mixed dwelling types, dwelling accessories, and customary facilities of the area that shall promote its self-containment such as home occupations and the like.&nbsp; The residential area has been increased from 35.0900 hectares to 35.7000hectares.&nbsp; This represents 24.85% of the total urban land area.

The commercial activities will be concentrated primarily in the central business district (CBD) in Poblacion but shall extend to areas counted in the other adjacent barangays.&nbsp; The central business district will include the public market and other individual commercial establishments. The urban commercial area shall not increase to remain at 2.4764hectaresunder the contention that the increase in commercial activity should be actually attained through a proper concentration of commerce in this designated area. Expansion in commercial areas shall be done in the other barangays. Provisions for increase in land uses for light agro-industrial activities scattered around the Poblacion is contemplated at 1.0800 hectares in anticipation of increased micro-industries to support commercial intensification.

The proposed built-up land use area shall include 43.2000 hectares of residential space plus 21.7901 hectares of subdivisions, 2.5836 hectares of commercial establishments and 22.0460 hectares of institutional space. The expected increase in the number of households accompanied by the unstable tenurial status of some of the residents on the lots and houses they occupy makes it necessary to identify some increase in residential land area.&nbsp; The increase in the area for residential land use also includes the half-hectare (0.50 hectare) socialized housing site in Ilio-Ilio. The existing subdivisions will also help absorb some of the housing needs.Commercial land use shall increase by 2.5000 hectares in anticipation of the putting up some commercial establishments in the other barangays, particularly in Pogoruac which is being designated as a second commercial growth point of Burgos. Additional commercial establishments are also contemplated along the national road in the barangays of Papallasen/San Pascual&nbsp; and the wet market in Don Matias, as well as along the road to barangay Cacayasen. Thus, an increase of 2.5 hectares in commercial land use is needed. The increase in institutional land use of 1.13 hectares is needed to put up health and day care centers in the different barangays within the planning period.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>2.2. Agricultural Lands: Strategic Agricultural Development Zone</em></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The agricultural lands of Burgos shall be classified as Strategic Agricultural Development Zone with a area of 3,277.1601 hectares or approximately 26% of the total land area of the municipality. Increases in strategic crop zone may be brought about by the operation of additional irrigation facilities. Vacant, idle and unproductive lands will all be rendered contributive to agricultural production.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The remaining Agriculture Lands around the municipality used for the grazing and pasture of animals by the residents account for 6938.1444&nbsp; hectares. They may also be considered for agricultural purposes. The agricultural uplands shall be protected by the municipality in view of the strategic plan of Burgos geared towards scenic tourism. Pasturelands may therefore lend themselves to other functions including tourism and outdoor activities. Proper management of these pasturelands shall be prioritized in the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>2.3. Industrial / Special Industrial Hub / Agro-Industrial Use</em></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To support the strategic agriculture development thrusts of the municipality, micro agri-industrieshave been envisioned to boost and support the local economy through the establishment agricultural processing industries, fruit processing industries, micro- and cottage industries for handicrafts. An increase to 1.1730 hectares is planned for micro agri-industries in the municipality. Two special industrial hubs which will be used to attract investors for industrial ventures are planned with an area of 5.0 hectares each in barangays Pogoruac and Papallasen. Agro-industrial areas remain at 686.7595 hectares.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>2.4.Forest Use</em></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The forests areas remain at 1,057.000 hectares. Further re-greening and reforestation programs shall be ensured to further the goal of forest preservation. Policies against the indiscriminate cutting of trees shall also be adopted in order to prevent erosion of slopes and maintain the geologic integrity of the mountain. The 93.000 hectares of protected forests shall be increased to 764 hectares making all unclassified forest lands as protected areas. The same 293.0000 hectares shall remain as production forests. Further re-greening and reforestation programs shall be ensured to further goal of protecting the forests of Burgos.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>2.5.Tourism Use</em></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An additional one hectare has been allotted for tourism development in the Caboangan beach area in Ilio-ilio.

PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.1.&nbsp; Functional Role of the Municipality</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The municipality of Burgos is recognized as an agricultural and agro-industrial municipality.&nbsp; The Provincial Physical Framework Plan (PPFP) of the Province of Pangasinan classifies Burgos as a satellite growth center, being connected to surrounding municipalities. The central portion of the municipality is identified as a highly restricted agricultural area (HRAA). Thus Burgos is basically designated as an agricultural municipality making vital contributions to the agricultural and industrial development of the province. The PPFP does not mention any particular industries that can be the focus of development in the municipality. Forest lands for preservation are identified in the northernmost part while also mentioning the mangrove areas of Burgos. Reforestation, low susceptibility to landslides and flooding are noted. Among the concerns identified in the municipality are the need for socialized housing in view of its informal settlers, the need for a health service and water and sanitary facilities.&nbsp; The national road passing through Burgos is seen as an important factor that may affect development in the municipality. In like manner, the provincial road to Ilio-Ilio has been earmarked for conversion as national road. The proposed Dasol-Burgos-Agno-Bani-Bolinao coastal road has also been identified as a major intervention in the municipality. Mapped under the PPFP, Burgos is visualized basically for production land use with grazing, pasture and agricultural lands. In line with all these, the municipality of Burgos should be developed as an agricultural municipalityable to provide support for the other urban centers of the province given its strategic location.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.2. Settlement Type</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Burgos is considered in the Provincial Physical Framework Plan as a 4<sup>th</sup> &nbsp;class municipality.

Population</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It has been projected that the municipality’s population will increase to 20,995 people by 2022. This population increase demands that the municipality provides more infrastructure facilities and services to address population demands.&nbsp; Apart from that, the provision of the needed land requirement to accommodate the population surplus as well as the observed informal settlements should be taken into account.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.4.

Alternative 1: Agro-commercial development strategy (Natural Growth Pattern)</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Agricultural growth coupled with commercialization is already the trend in the municipality that coincides with what may be seen as the natural growth pattern that intends to followpast trends.&nbsp; The plan involves letting the urban area and other population centers develop following their natural tendency.&nbsp; Minimal local government intervention is required in implementing this type of development.The primary interventions shall be in protecting prime agricultural areas and providing agricultural support facilities and services. This shall be combined with efforts to increase access to markets through commercialization. Following the natural growth pattern, services and opportunities shall be concentrated in the barangays of the Poblacion and other areas such as the barangay of Pogoruac. Settlements and their support activities shall be developed along the existing major transportation and communication routes. (See Map No. 3, Natural Growth Pattern Map). Maintenance and upgrading of these primary routes shall be done to ensure mobility and to enhance accessibility.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The advantage of this form of development is the decongestion of the sole urban barangay of Burgos. It also means maximizing the use of the major road trunk line.&nbsp; In the long run however, this development plan tends to result in land use patterns that undermine the feasibility and opportunity of designing urban development in potential expansion areas.&nbsp; At the same time, it accelerates the conversion of prime agricultural areas from which the residents derive their daily sustenance. Thus the long-term effect negates the initial advantages gained.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>2.2. Alternative 2: Rapid Commercio-Industrialization Strategy (Classic Stellar or Constellation Pattern)</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Still connected with the first alternative, this second development thrusts includes industrialization as a partner of commercialization. This strategy would require the putting up of support services, facilities and utilities that shall support industrial activities.&nbsp; This strategy takes advantage of the agri-business and agri-industrial potentials of the municipality to complement the agricultural sector. Intensified commercialization shall take the form of providing trading centers (primarily for livestock) highlighting the envisioned roleof the municipality as a livestock provider for the whole province. Industrial and commercial facilities shall be used to attract investments into the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This kind of development sees a spatial strategy corresponding to the Classic Stellar or Constellation Model which is based on Hoyt’stheory that urban growth and development tends to follow major transportation and communications routes radiating away from the urban core. Such a development aided by government regulation and intervention assumes the shape of a starfish whose limbs symbolize the radiating arms of development. Applied to Burgos, the Poblacion is to be targeted as the center of &nbsp;development. Growth impetus is expected to spread outwards to the peripheral barangays along the major trunk lines. The concept, therefore, approximates a regulated form of the natural growth model but is also is be-saddled by that model’s negative collateral consequences.The main limitation of this model is that it makes no reference to out of town development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This model takes into account the observation that it is common for households to be near road lines, and commercial establishments to be along business thoroughfares. Recognizing that the various transportation routes into an urban area represented greater access, cities tended to grow in wedge-shaped patterns -- or sectors -- emanating from the central business district and centered on major transportation routes. Higher levels of access meant higher land values, thus, many commercial functions would remain in the central business district (the Poblacion) but manufacturing functions would develop in a wedge surrounding transportation routes. Residential functions would grow in wedge-shaped patterns.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Map No. 4, Classic Stellar Map, illustrates the Classic Stellar or Constellation model for Burgos.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3. THE STRUCTURE PLAN</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The definitive development thrust chosen for Burgos has been guided, to a large extent, by the municipality’s formulated vision and mission which, in turn, shaped the goals and strategies formulated from the different sectoral studies.

Planning Concepts on Land</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>a. Land as Space</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Land as form and space is where life takes place and moves, making land a subject of various studies on geography, or the study of distribution of variables in land as space.&nbsp; As a space, land is deemed fixed in area.&nbsp; Only in exceptional cases does land increase in area such as reclamation.&nbsp; As a space, Land is occupied and utilized for various purposes usually in increasing requirements.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>b. Land as Location</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This concept considers the factor of land as a point in space wherein relative distance to other locations of different variables in spaces is studied.&nbsp; Location is a major factor affecting the value and uses of land.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>c. Land as Property</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This concept considers the ownership rights of individuals and/or groups.&nbsp; Within the context of the development proposals, the ownership right to use land as property is subjected to the regulations of the state for the purposes of general welfare and the optimum and efficient use of land as a resource.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3.1.2. Concepts and Principles in Land Use Planning</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>a. High/Best/Optimum Use</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Land is considered at its highest and optimum use when its use is for the purpose or combination of purposes, and in which it has the highest comparative advantage, or the least comparative disadvantage relative to other uses.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>b. Compatible Use</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A land use is considered compatible of said use if it could be in harmony with uses of land adjacent to the subject land use and/or to the dominant land use within the vicinity of subject land use.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>c. Land as limited fixed resource and as such must be managed for the welfare, and in accordance to the community’s operation as reflected in their development plan.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>d. The environment provides man with life supporting system and as such it shall be conserved and developed to enhance the quality of life.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>e. Land must be used in the most beneficial, rational and most efficient manner so as to prevent the mixture of incompatible uses, environmental hazards, slight depletion and degradation of land resources.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>f. There is a need for regulatory measures to promote the desired pattern of land use as proposed in this Comprehensive Land Use Plan.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>g. The concept of Hierarchy of Settlements</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Settlements naturally develop in varying degrees could be categorized into a hierarchical order of functions.&nbsp; Said natural development trends could, however be altered by planning efforts to effect the desired and efficient distribution of the hierarchical order of functions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>h. Growth Center Strategy</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This physical development strategy considers the situation with limited resources and the possible situation of such limited resources not efficiently distributed in land as space.&nbsp; Due to this situation, levels and types of growth centers are identified and located equitably as focal delivery points for specific types of services, facilities and resource opportunities to serve the designated influence area in an efficient manner.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>i. Concentric Development</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This physical development strategy takes into consideration the dispersal of activities within an urban core or center by expanding on the areas contiguous to, or adjacent to and beyond that core.&nbsp; The immediate and outer peripheries of the urban core are identified as the expansion area of urban growth and development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>j. Linear or Strip Development</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This physical development strategy follows trends that urban development form along major routes or trunk lines for transportation and communication.&nbsp; It is aimed to develop new hubs of economic activities along the major routes to disperse effects to its outlying areas.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>k. Central and Nodal Development</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This development concept follows a certain hierarchy of functions and sizes.&nbsp; The central point of activity is focused on the identified major growth center supported by growth nodes around it. It is assumed that the major growth center shall provide specialized facilities and services, which shall trickle out to the growth nodes.&nbsp; It also serves as the external link of the municipality to other municipalities and cities.&nbsp; The nodes, on the other hand, provide support to the major growth center as its captive market of both labor and resources, and at the same time disperse development services to its influence areas.&nbsp; An efficient circulation system is required to achieve complementarity of the major growth center and the nodes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3.2.&nbsp; Structure Plan</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The following structure plan is based on the preferred development strategy of Burgos described as<strong><em>agro-commercio-industrial &amp;agri-tourism management strategy</em></strong>. The structure plan, on the other hand is described as the <strong><em>Multi-Point Scenic Agricultural Development Model</em></strong>. The strategic plan makes a case for the preservation of the agricultural character of Burgos arguing that the municipality may be developed as a showcase agricultural community supported by agriculture-based commerce and industry, facilitated by its connectivity to other areas within the province via the road network, and guided by an aspiration to preserve its agricultural character.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This development plan lends a strong support for economic development that retains Burgos’ agricultural character and protects its important natural resources and pristine environment. Development in Burgos should maintain the quality of life of its people provided by a landscape dominated by farming, resource preservation, scenic areas and many opportunities for outdoor activities, while supporting the harvesting of agricultural products and other land based economic development. In keeping with this image, traditional economic growth should be encouraged in areas where infrastructure already exists or may be easily extended in order to minimize environmental degradation and haphazard transformation of the municipality’s character.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The said strategy is depicted in the following diagramand presented in the Structure/Concept Plan Map (See Map No. 5 and figure 3).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The diagram illustrates the preferred land use strategy of Burgos which tries to embody the harmony between agriculture-led development and the preservation of the agricultural town character of Burgos, hence the notion of&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>“<em>scenic agricultural development</em>.”</strong> While economic development via agriculture is the goal, the strategy aims to achieve this goal together with proper management of land uses that preserves the countryside character of the municipality. This is done, as shown in the diagram, through the interplay of three main “<strong><em>land use development blocks”</em></strong>or areasin the municipality, namely: (1) the commercial blocks, (2) agricultural blocks and (3) scenic blocks. Land uses in these areas are to be guided by the characteristics sought to be preserved in these blocks as described below. Zoning is thus understood in its ecological sense of designating areas with a distinct or characteristic system determined largely by its environment. Designated by translucent areas in the diagram (red for commercial blocks, green for agricultural blocks and light green scenic blocks), these blocks signify how artificial boundaries in the municipality’s land uses are transcended through the integration of space.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In order to orchestrate development in these blocks, the model calls for the designation of components of a system that may be designated as specific points of intervention or as the designated components of a multi-point approach resting on the identification of strategic barangays in the municipality. Instead of concentrating on one or two barangays as points of development, the model advocates systematically distributing development efforts in several barangays or “<strong><em>multi-points of growth</em></strong>.”&nbsp; Designated as growth points, these points are identified to provide the impetus for development in agriculture and agro-forestry, commerce and industry, and tourism. Encouraging economic activities in these multiple points will help reduce the likelihood of haphazard strip development along existing roads which may, above all, work to destroy the agricultural character of the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:table -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Figure 3&nbsp;&nbsp; : MULTI-POINT SCENIC AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT MODEL</strong><strong></strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong></strong> Scenic Blocks (Forest/Pasture) Agri-Commercial Point (Poblacion&amp; Adjacent barangays) Agri-ScenicPoints (Concordia-Sapa Grande- Sapa Pequena) &nbsp; Agricultural Blocks (Farmlands) Agri-Forest &amp;Mariculture Points (Ilio-ilio &amp; Cacayasen) Agri-TourismPoint (Cabongaoan Beach, Ilio-ilio) Commercial &amp; Industrial Blocks &nbsp; &nbsp; Potential Coastal Road Agri-Industrial Point (Pogoruac/Papallasen)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n<!-- /wp:table -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>a. The Land Use Development Blocks</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This strategy takes-off from the observation that Burgos has acquired an agricultural character through development that has kept large portions of the municipality in unsullied conditions. This plan focuses on amplifying and riding on this characteristic which can be presented as the specific difference Burgos. The rural agricultural character of Burgos exists due to the scenic vistas, large uninterrupted farmlands and pasturelands, forested areas, and limited and scattered development along the roads. This agricultural character should be of importance in planning for the municipality.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The agricultural character of Burgos may be evaluated from three perspectives represented by the three land-use-development-blocks- (1) the scenic blocks, (2) the agricultural block, and (3) the commercial blocks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Scenic Block</em>s</strong> are conceived from the vantage point of the road connecting the Poblacion to Ilio-ilio. The scenic blocks are to be characterized by views of fairly open areas adjacent to farmlands. More distant views of forested ridgelines shall also be highlighted. The several large farms along the road network shall add to the scenic agricultural character of the municipality. Scattered single family dwellings, some newer and some historic, located along the roadshall be kept. These views should be consciously protected in planning. The municipal protected areas should therefore include those areas within the forestry, pastureland and farmlands.&nbsp; Proper planning and zoning should allow the protection of these areas without limiting economic development through conservation easements. Basically, this should mean that the scenic views will be afforded some level of protection from indiscriminate development. It should be noted that many of the unprotected areas in Burgos are open fields and farms where future development would be highly visible. Development along the roads needs to preserve the open fields and farms and provide a visual and functional relationship of structures to the surrounding landscape. Development guidelines should be established to help protect the open fields along the scenic views from the road while still allowing controlled development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Commercial / Industrial Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the Poblacion and the national road network passing through the Poblacion which connotes a well-defined route along Burgos to the other municipalities in Western Pangasinan and the sites of agri-industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen. Thesecommercial areasareto be characterizedby mix of land uses with planned pockets of commercial areas, particularly in the Poblacion immediately adjacent barangays. The compact development of the Poblacion with its defined entry points and the fact that itserves as a center for local commercial and institutional activities defines its agricultural and commercial character. The sites of the industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be presented as areas for investments in industrial ventures. Development guidelines should allow and encourage the continuation of the village-style development in this area. Despite the commercialization to be allowed, economic development that promotes the viability of the working landscape should be designed along with forestry and agriculture-related enterprises that preserve the character of Burgos.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agricultural Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the productive agricultural lands in the Poblacion to San Vicente and San Miguel areas, as well as the agricultural areas in the western barangays of the municipality. The goal should be to stimulate appropriate economic development and provide opportunity for individuals to establish agriculture-based ventures in these areas. Economic development in the different barangays should reinforce traditional settlement patterns, protect the agricultural character of the municipality and revitalize village and growth centers. This plan therefore declares that the best interest of Burgos is to see to it that new development occurs in amanner that does not change the basic land use patterns, and consequently the character of Burgos. Therefore, the multiple points identified to function as growth centers below should be the focus for mixed-use, higher intensity development and new growth.&nbsp; Outlying areas should be designed and managed so as not to compromise the agricultural character of Burgos or its important natural resources.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>b. The Multi-Points of Growth</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The identified growth points are: (1) the Agri-Commercial points (i.e., the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac), (2) the Agri-InustriaLpoints (the barangays of PogoruacandPapallasen), (3) the Agri-Forest Mariculture points (i.e., the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen), (4) the Agri-Scenic points (i.e., the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena), and (5) the Agri-Tourism point (i.e., Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio). Calling these growth points by names prefixed by “agriculture” (i.e., Agri) emphasizes the role that agriculture is supposed to play in shaping the development of Burgos in combination with&nbsp; commerce and industry, fishing and aquaculture, tourism, and scenic management of the farmlands, forests and pasturelands.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The model advises that development interventions should be concentrated in these growth points while eventually seeing their effects on the other barangays. By deliberately planning changes in these growth points, harmonious changes in the three land-use-development-blocks are sought. Thus, the growth points are expected to generate further growth in surrounding barangays. The strategy aims to develop growth points as the foci for intervention.&nbsp; Apart from helping de-concentrate development away from the traditional centers, it is also designed to create new catchments for dispersing industry, commerce and people.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Commercial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate commercial activities by inducing entrepreneurs and investors to put up commercial shops and outlets in the Poblacion’s central business district and Pogoruac as the alternative commercial growth center in the opposite end of the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Industrial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate industrial activities primarily stemming from the invitation for industrial venture investments in two industrial hubs in the two said barangays.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Forest Mariculture Points</em></strong> are set in the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen. Both Ilio-ilo and Cacayasen are the sites forests areas Burgos. With the aim of expanding the protected forests in the municipality, these two barangays shall be the centers of forest management efforts.&nbsp; Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen are also the sites of substantial fishing activities. The coastal Ilio-ilio produces marine catch for local consumption while Cacayasen, with its fishponds is strategically the most favorable area for aquaculture since it is a low lying area where water is retained in natural and artificial ponds. This inherent geographical characteristic of the barangay which may render it non-conducive to farming and raising livestock warrants planning to developing it as a zone for aquaculture.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Scenic Points</em></strong> shall be the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena. Spatially, these three barangays form a belt which is transected by the road network. These three barangays, will serve as sections of the municipality’s transportation and utility corridor. Planning in these barangays should maximize productive land use without severing farm units while facilitating access for producers and harvesters. Guided by the goal of preserving the scenic stretches along the route, every effort should be made to avoid impairment of agricultural lands as well as the pasturelands. Proper planning in these barangays will ensure that the transportation and utility corridor will be managed carefully in the context of the agricultural lands and uses through which it passes. The transportation facilities should complement and serve, rather than harm the municipality’s farmlands, pastureland and agriculture industry through which they pass.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Tourism Point</em></strong> is the Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio. Cabongaoan shall serve as the end-point of a tourism destination which should include the whole of the municipality- branded as “scenic agricultural tourism.” This tourism concept is based on the design that the municipality can be presented as an agricultural community with distinct assets. Visitors can come in search of peaceful relaxation, inspiration, recreation, education and entertainment. Among the tourism assets of Burgos which can be the content of its marketing efforts should be its small town atmosphere, scenery, agricultural tourism, outdoor recreation, festivals and events, and&nbsp; environmental wonders culminating in its clean beach and coast&nbsp; in Cabongaoan.&nbsp; Thus, tourism in Burgos becomes not just an isolated activity in Cabongaoan but a municipality-wide promotion. Cabongaoan should be planned as the final destination at the end of the scenic corridor passing through the agricultural and scenic blocks of the municipality and as destination along the proposed coastal road of the province.&nbsp; To be effective, Cabongaoan should unify Burgos’ agricultural and rural community with beach tourism where functional and emotional benefits will be open to visitors. The whole of Burgos should therefore be considered as tourist destination and not only its beach.<strong><br></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'THE CONCEPT / STRUCTURE PLAN', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '109-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-09-13 11:31:40', '2020-09-13 11:31:40', '', 109, 'https://localhost/git/burgos-website/?p=133', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.1.&nbsp; Functional Role of the Municipality</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The municipality of Burgos is recognized as an agricultural and agro-industrial municipality.&nbsp; The Provincial Physical Framework Plan (PPFP) of the Province of Pangasinan classifies Burgos as a satellite growth center, being connected to surrounding municipalities. The central portion of the municipality is identified as a highly restricted agricultural area (HRAA). Thus Burgos is basically designated as an agricultural municipality making vital contributions to the agricultural and industrial development of the province. The PPFP does not mention any particular industries that can be the focus of development in the municipality. Forest lands for preservation are identified in the northernmost part while also mentioning the mangrove areas of Burgos. Reforestation, low susceptibility to landslides and flooding are noted. Among the concerns identified in the municipality are the need for socialized housing in view of its informal settlers, the need for a health service and water and sanitary facilities.&nbsp; The national road passing through Burgos is seen as an important factor that may affect development in the municipality. In like manner, the provincial road to Ilio-Ilio has been earmarked for conversion as national road. The proposed Dasol-Burgos-Agno-Bani-Bolinao coastal road has also been identified as a major intervention in the municipality. Mapped under the PPFP, Burgos is visualized basically for production land use with grazing, pasture and agricultural lands. In line with all these, the municipality of Burgos should be developed as an agricultural municipalityable to provide support for the other urban centers of the province given its strategic location.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.2. Settlement Type</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Burgos is considered in the Provincial Physical Framework Plan as a 4<sup>th</sup> &nbsp;class municipality. The municipality shall remain as a small town, thus Burgos has adopted the same as its settlement goal until the end of the planning period.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.3. Population</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It has been projected that the municipality’s population will increase to 20,995 people by 2022. This population increase demands that the municipality provides more infrastructure facilities and services to address population demands.&nbsp; Apart from that, the provision of the needed land requirement to accommodate the population surplus as well as the observed informal settlements should be taken into account.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.4. Existing and Future Resource Opportunities and Constraints</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.4.1.

The upgrading of the existing commercial business district and the public market should be prioritized extending to stretches along the national highway. A satellite commercial district in the other end of the municipality should be developed.These commercial support facilities shall serve asalternative growth centers. The commercial focus of the municipality shall be further enhanced by marketing its central position to the other surrounding municipalities in the province.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>- Expansion of communication and transportation services</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The local government shall continue in efforts to establish moderntransportation and communication facilities and services tosupport economic revitalization.&nbsp; In order to speed up profitable economic transactions, the municipality shall provide for these facilities highlighting its connectivity with other municipalities. An area also targeted for expansion is the avenue of Internet access for all capable residents in order for them to be linked to the global information technology net. Transport activities along the major roads shall also be expanded.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>- Identification and advancement of tourism potentials</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Tourism shall be included in the thrusts of the municipality focused in its coastal areas.&nbsp; The tourism potentials of the municipality shall be roused by way of presenting the rural character of Burgos showcased along the major road network and connected to the coastal tourist attraction.&nbsp; Support facilities and activities shall be planned for and developed through specific tourism objectives on the coastal barangay radiating to adjacent barangays.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>- Promotion of Environmental Protection</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The maintenance of the natural resources of the municipality shall fostered by emphasizing scenic tourism and protection.

Alternative 1: Agro-commercial development strategy (Natural Growth Pattern)</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Agricultural growth coupled with commercialization is already the trend in the municipality that coincides with what may be seen as the natural growth pattern that intends to followpast trends.&nbsp; The plan involves letting the urban area and other population centers develop following their natural tendency.&nbsp; Minimal local government intervention is required in implementing this type of development.The primary interventions shall be in protecting prime agricultural areas and providing agricultural support facilities and services. This shall be combined with efforts to increase access to markets through commercialization. Following the natural growth pattern, services and opportunities shall be concentrated in the barangays of the Poblacion and other areas such as the barangay of Pogoruac. Settlements and their support activities shall be developed along the existing major transportation and communication routes. (See Map No. 3, Natural Growth Pattern Map). Maintenance and upgrading of these primary routes shall be done to ensure mobility and to enhance accessibility.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The advantage of this form of development is the decongestion of the sole urban barangay of Burgos. It also means maximizing the use of the major road trunk line.&nbsp; In the long run however, this development plan tends to result in land use patterns that undermine the feasibility and opportunity of designing urban development in potential expansion areas.&nbsp; At the same time, it accelerates the conversion of prime agricultural areas from which the residents derive their daily sustenance. Thus the long-term effect negates the initial advantages gained.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>2.2. Alternative 2: Rapid Commercio-Industrialization Strategy (Classic Stellar or Constellation Pattern)</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Still connected with the first alternative, this second development thrusts includes industrialization as a partner of commercialization. This strategy would require the putting up of support services, facilities and utilities that shall support industrial activities.&nbsp; This strategy takes advantage of the agri-business and agri-industrial potentials of the municipality to complement the agricultural sector. Intensified commercialization shall take the form of providing trading centers (primarily for livestock) highlighting the envisioned roleof the municipality as a livestock provider for the whole province. Industrial and commercial facilities shall be used to attract investments into the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This kind of development sees a spatial strategy corresponding to the Classic Stellar or Constellation Model which is based on Hoyt’stheory that urban growth and development tends to follow major transportation and communications routes radiating away from the urban core. Such a development aided by government regulation and intervention assumes the shape of a starfish whose limbs symbolize the radiating arms of development. Applied to Burgos, the Poblacion is to be targeted as the center of &nbsp;development. Growth impetus is expected to spread outwards to the peripheral barangays along the major trunk lines. The concept, therefore, approximates a regulated form of the natural growth model but is also is be-saddled by that model’s negative collateral consequences.The main limitation of this model is that it makes no reference to out of town development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This model takes into account the observation that it is common for households to be near road lines, and commercial establishments to be along business thoroughfares. Recognizing that the various transportation routes into an urban area represented greater access, cities tended to grow in wedge-shaped patterns -- or sectors -- emanating from the central business district and centered on major transportation routes. Higher levels of access meant higher land values, thus, many commercial functions would remain in the central business district (the Poblacion) but manufacturing functions would develop in a wedge surrounding transportation routes. Residential functions would grow in wedge-shaped patterns.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Map No. 4, Classic Stellar Map, illustrates the Classic Stellar or Constellation model for Burgos.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3. THE STRUCTURE PLAN</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The definitive development thrust chosen for Burgos has been guided, to a large extent, by the municipality’s formulated vision and mission which, in turn, shaped the goals and strategies formulated from the different sectoral studies. Thus, the &nbsp;Goals Achievement Matrix (GAM) was the main tool used in analyzing the different alternatives development thrusts for the municipality. This structure plan presents the chosen development thrust.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3.1.Physical Development Concepts and Strategies Utilized</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3.1.1. Planning Concepts on Land</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>a. Land as Space</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Land as form and space is where life takes place and moves, making land a subject of various studies on geography, or the study of distribution of variables in land as space.&nbsp; As a space, land is deemed fixed in area.&nbsp; Only in exceptional cases does land increase in area such as reclamation.&nbsp; As a space, Land is occupied and utilized for various purposes usually in increasing requirements.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>b. Land as Location</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This concept considers the factor of land as a point in space wherein relative distance to other locations of different variables in spaces is studied.&nbsp; Location is a major factor affecting the value and uses of land.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>c. Land as Property</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This concept considers the ownership rights of individuals and/or groups.&nbsp; Within the context of the development proposals, the ownership right to use land as property is subjected to the regulations of the state for the purposes of general welfare and the optimum and efficient use of land as a resource.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3.1.2. Concepts and Principles in Land Use Planning</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>a. High/Best/Optimum Use</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Land is considered at its highest and optimum use when its use is for the purpose or combination of purposes, and in which it has the highest comparative advantage, or the least comparative disadvantage relative to other uses.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>b. Compatible Use</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A land use is considered compatible of said use if it could be in harmony with uses of land adjacent to the subject land use and/or to the dominant land use within the vicinity of subject land use.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>c. Land as limited fixed resource and as such must be managed for the welfare, and in accordance to the community’s operation as reflected in their development plan.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>d. The environment provides man with life supporting system and as such it shall be conserved and developed to enhance the quality of life.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>e. Land must be used in the most beneficial, rational and most efficient manner so as to prevent the mixture of incompatible uses, environmental hazards, slight depletion and degradation of land resources.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>f. There is a need for regulatory measures to promote the desired pattern of land use as proposed in this Comprehensive Land Use Plan.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>g. The concept of Hierarchy of Settlements</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Settlements naturally develop in varying degrees could be categorized into a hierarchical order of functions.&nbsp; Said natural development trends could, however be altered by planning efforts to effect the desired and efficient distribution of the hierarchical order of functions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>h. Growth Center Strategy</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This physical development strategy considers the situation with limited resources and the possible situation of such limited resources not efficiently distributed in land as space.&nbsp; Due to this situation, levels and types of growth centers are identified and located equitably as focal delivery points for specific types of services, facilities and resource opportunities to serve the designated influence area in an efficient manner.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>i. Concentric Development</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This physical development strategy takes into consideration the dispersal of activities within an urban core or center by expanding on the areas contiguous to, or adjacent to and beyond that core.&nbsp; The immediate and outer peripheries of the urban core are identified as the expansion area of urban growth and development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>j. Linear or Strip Development</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This physical development strategy follows trends that urban development form along major routes or trunk lines for transportation and communication.&nbsp; It is aimed to develop new hubs of economic activities along the major routes to disperse effects to its outlying areas.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>k. Central and Nodal Development</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This development concept follows a certain hierarchy of functions and sizes.&nbsp; The central point of activity is focused on the identified major growth center supported by growth nodes around it. It is assumed that the major growth center shall provide specialized facilities and services, which shall trickle out to the growth nodes.&nbsp; It also serves as the external link of the municipality to other municipalities and cities.&nbsp; The nodes, on the other hand, provide support to the major growth center as its captive market of both labor and resources, and at the same time disperse development services to its influence areas.&nbsp; An efficient circulation system is required to achieve complementarity of the major growth center and the nodes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3.2.&nbsp; Structure Plan</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The following structure plan is based on the preferred development strategy of Burgos described as<strong><em>agro-commercio-industrial &amp;agri-tourism management strategy</em></strong>. The structure plan, on the other hand is described as the <strong><em>Multi-Point Scenic Agricultural Development Model</em></strong>. The strategic plan makes a case for the preservation of the agricultural character of Burgos arguing that the municipality may be developed as a showcase agricultural community supported by agriculture-based commerce and industry, facilitated by its connectivity to other areas within the province via the road network, and guided by an aspiration to preserve its agricultural character.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This development plan lends a strong support for economic development that retains Burgos’ agricultural character and protects its important natural resources and pristine environment. Development in Burgos should maintain the quality of life of its people provided by a landscape dominated by farming, resource preservation, scenic areas and many opportunities for outdoor activities, while supporting the harvesting of agricultural products and other land based economic development. In keeping with this image, traditional economic growth should be encouraged in areas where infrastructure already exists or may be easily extended in order to minimize environmental degradation and haphazard transformation of the municipality’s character.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The said strategy is depicted in the following diagramand presented in the Structure/Concept Plan Map (See Map No. 5 and figure 3).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The diagram illustrates the preferred land use strategy of Burgos which tries to embody the harmony between agriculture-led development and the preservation of the agricultural town character of Burgos, hence the notion of&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>“<em>scenic agricultural development</em>.”</strong> While economic development via agriculture is the goal, the strategy aims to achieve this goal together with proper management of land uses that preserves the countryside character of the municipality. This is done, as shown in the diagram, through the interplay of three main “<strong><em>land use development blocks”</em></strong>or areasin the municipality, namely: (1) the commercial blocks, (2) agricultural blocks and (3) scenic blocks. Land uses in these areas are to be guided by the characteristics sought to be preserved in these blocks as described below. Zoning is thus understood in its ecological sense of designating areas with a distinct or characteristic system determined largely by its environment. Designated by translucent areas in the diagram (red for commercial blocks, green for agricultural blocks and light green scenic blocks), these blocks signify how artificial boundaries in the municipality’s land uses are transcended through the integration of space.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In order to orchestrate development in these blocks, the model calls for the designation of components of a system that may be designated as specific points of intervention or as the designated components of a multi-point approach resting on the identification of strategic barangays in the municipality. Instead of concentrating on one or two barangays as points of development, the model advocates systematically distributing development efforts in several barangays or “<strong><em>multi-points of growth</em></strong>.”&nbsp; Designated as growth points, these points are identified to provide the impetus for development in agriculture and agro-forestry, commerce and industry, and tourism. Encouraging economic activities in these multiple points will help reduce the likelihood of haphazard strip development along existing roads which may, above all, work to destroy the agricultural character of the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:table -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Figure 3&nbsp;&nbsp; : MULTI-POINT SCENIC AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT MODEL</strong><strong></strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong></strong> Scenic Blocks (Forest/Pasture) Agri-Commercial Point (Poblacion&amp; Adjacent barangays) Agri-ScenicPoints (Concordia-Sapa Grande- Sapa Pequena) &nbsp; Agricultural Blocks (Farmlands) Agri-Forest &amp;Mariculture Points (Ilio-ilio &amp; Cacayasen) Agri-TourismPoint (Cabongaoan Beach, Ilio-ilio) Commercial &amp; Industrial Blocks &nbsp; &nbsp; Potential Coastal Road Agri-Industrial Point (Pogoruac/Papallasen)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n<!-- /wp:table -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>a. The Land Use Development Blocks</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This strategy takes-off from the observation that Burgos has acquired an agricultural character through development that has kept large portions of the municipality in unsullied conditions. This plan focuses on amplifying and riding on this characteristic which can be presented as the specific difference Burgos. The rural agricultural character of Burgos exists due to the scenic vistas, large uninterrupted farmlands and pasturelands, forested areas, and limited and scattered development along the roads. This agricultural character should be of importance in planning for the municipality.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The agricultural character of Burgos may be evaluated from three perspectives represented by the three land-use-development-blocks- (1) the scenic blocks, (2) the agricultural block, and (3) the commercial blocks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Scenic Block</em>s</strong> are conceived from the vantage point of the road connecting the Poblacion to Ilio-ilio. The scenic blocks are to be characterized by views of fairly open areas adjacent to farmlands. More distant views of forested ridgelines shall also be highlighted. The several large farms along the road network shall add to the scenic agricultural character of the municipality. Scattered single family dwellings, some newer and some historic, located along the roadshall be kept. These views should be consciously protected in planning. The municipal protected areas should therefore include those areas within the forestry, pastureland and farmlands.&nbsp; Proper planning and zoning should allow the protection of these areas without limiting economic development through conservation easements. Basically, this should mean that the scenic views will be afforded some level of protection from indiscriminate development. It should be noted that many of the unprotected areas in Burgos are open fields and farms where future development would be highly visible. Development along the roads needs to preserve the open fields and farms and provide a visual and functional relationship of structures to the surrounding landscape. Development guidelines should be established to help protect the open fields along the scenic views from the road while still allowing controlled development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Commercial / Industrial Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the Poblacion and the national road network passing through the Poblacion which connotes a well-defined route along Burgos to the other municipalities in Western Pangasinan and the sites of agri-industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen. Thesecommercial areasareto be characterizedby mix of land uses with planned pockets of commercial areas, particularly in the Poblacion immediately adjacent barangays. The compact development of the Poblacion with its defined entry points and the fact that itserves as a center for local commercial and institutional activities defines its agricultural and commercial character. The sites of the industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be presented as areas for investments in industrial ventures. Development guidelines should allow and encourage the continuation of the village-style development in this area. Despite the commercialization to be allowed, economic development that promotes the viability of the working landscape should be designed along with forestry and agriculture-related enterprises that preserve the character of Burgos.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agricultural Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the productive agricultural lands in the Poblacion to San Vicente and San Miguel areas, as well as the agricultural areas in the western barangays of the municipality. The goal should be to stimulate appropriate economic development and provide opportunity for individuals to establish agriculture-based ventures in these areas. Economic development in the different barangays should reinforce traditional settlement patterns, protect the agricultural character of the municipality and revitalize village and growth centers. This plan therefore declares that the best interest of Burgos is to see to it that new development occurs in amanner that does not change the basic land use patterns, and consequently the character of Burgos. Therefore, the multiple points identified to function as growth centers below should be the focus for mixed-use, higher intensity development and new growth.&nbsp; Outlying areas should be designed and managed so as not to compromise the agricultural character of Burgos or its important natural resources.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>b. The Multi-Points of Growth</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The identified growth points are: (1) the Agri-Commercial points (i.e., the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac), (2) the Agri-InustriaLpoints (the barangays of PogoruacandPapallasen), (3) the Agri-Forest Mariculture points (i.e., the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen), (4) the Agri-Scenic points (i.e., the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena), and (5) the Agri-Tourism point (i.e., Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio). Calling these growth points by names prefixed by “agriculture” (i.e., Agri) emphasizes the role that agriculture is supposed to play in shaping the development of Burgos in combination with&nbsp; commerce and industry, fishing and aquaculture, tourism, and scenic management of the farmlands, forests and pasturelands.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The model advises that development interventions should be concentrated in these growth points while eventually seeing their effects on the other barangays. By deliberately planning changes in these growth points, harmonious changes in the three land-use-development-blocks are sought. Thus, the growth points are expected to generate further growth in surrounding barangays. The strategy aims to develop growth points as the foci for intervention.&nbsp; Apart from helping de-concentrate development away from the traditional centers, it is also designed to create new catchments for dispersing industry, commerce and people.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Commercial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate commercial activities by inducing entrepreneurs and investors to put up commercial shops and outlets in the Poblacion’s central business district and Pogoruac as the alternative commercial growth center in the opposite end of the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Industrial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate industrial activities primarily stemming from the invitation for industrial venture investments in two industrial hubs in the two said barangays.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Forest Mariculture Points</em></strong> are set in the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen. Both Ilio-ilo and Cacayasen are the sites forests areas Burgos. With the aim of expanding the protected forests in the municipality, these two barangays shall be the centers of forest management efforts.&nbsp; Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen are also the sites of substantial fishing activities. The coastal Ilio-ilio produces marine catch for local consumption while Cacayasen, with its fishponds is strategically the most favorable area for aquaculture since it is a low lying area where water is retained in natural and artificial ponds. This inherent geographical characteristic of the barangay which may render it non-conducive to farming and raising livestock warrants planning to developing it as a zone for aquaculture.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Scenic Points</em></strong> shall be the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena. Spatially, these three barangays form a belt which is transected by the road network. These three barangays, will serve as sections of the municipality’s transportation and utility corridor. Planning in these barangays should maximize productive land use without severing farm units while facilitating access for producers and harvesters. Guided by the goal of preserving the scenic stretches along the route, every effort should be made to avoid impairment of agricultural lands as well as the pasturelands. Proper planning in these barangays will ensure that the transportation and utility corridor will be managed carefully in the context of the agricultural lands and uses through which it passes. The transportation facilities should complement and serve, rather than harm the municipality’s farmlands, pastureland and agriculture industry through which they pass.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Tourism Point</em></strong> is the Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio. Cabongaoan shall serve as the end-point of a tourism destination which should include the whole of the municipality- branded as “scenic agricultural tourism.” This tourism concept is based on the design that the municipality can be presented as an agricultural community with distinct assets. Visitors can come in search of peaceful relaxation, inspiration, recreation, education and entertainment. Among the tourism assets of Burgos which can be the content of its marketing efforts should be its small town atmosphere, scenery, agricultural tourism, outdoor recreation, festivals and events, and&nbsp; environmental wonders culminating in its clean beach and coast&nbsp; in Cabongaoan.&nbsp; Thus, tourism in Burgos becomes not just an isolated activity in Cabongaoan but a municipality-wide promotion. Cabongaoan should be planned as the final destination at the end of the scenic corridor passing through the agricultural and scenic blocks of the municipality and as destination along the proposed coastal road of the province.&nbsp; To be effective, Cabongaoan should unify Burgos’ agricultural and rural community with beach tourism where functional and emotional benefits will be open to visitors. The whole of Burgos should therefore be considered as tourist destination and not only its beach.<strong><br></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'THE CONCEPT / STRUCTURE PLAN', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '109-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-09-13 11:41:27', '2020-09-13 11:41:27', '', 109, 'https://localhost/git/burgos-website/?p=136', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.1.&nbsp; Functional Role of the Municipality</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The municipality of Burgos is recognized as an agricultural and agro-industrial municipality.&nbsp; The Provincial Physical Framework Plan (PPFP) of the Province of Pangasinan classifies Burgos as a satellite growth center, being connected to surrounding municipalities. The central portion of the municipality is identified as a highly restricted agricultural area (HRAA). Thus Burgos is basically designated as an agricultural municipality making vital contributions to the agricultural and industrial development of the province. The PPFP does not mention any particular industries that can be the focus of development in the municipality. Forest lands for preservation are identified in the northernmost part while also mentioning the mangrove areas of Burgos. Reforestation, low susceptibility to landslides and flooding are noted. Among the concerns identified in the municipality are the need for socialized housing in view of its informal settlers, the need for a health service and water and sanitary facilities.&nbsp; The national road passing through Burgos is seen as an important factor that may affect development in the municipality. In like manner, the provincial road to Ilio-Ilio has been earmarked for conversion as national road. The proposed Dasol-Burgos-Agno-Bani-Bolinao coastal road has also been identified as a major intervention in the municipality. Mapped under the PPFP, Burgos is visualized basically for production land use with grazing, pasture and agricultural lands. In line with all these, the municipality of Burgos should be developed as an agricultural municipalityable to provide support for the other urban centers of the province given its strategic location.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.2. Settlement Type</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Burgos is considered in the Provincial Physical Framework Plan as a 4<sup>th</sup> &nbsp;class municipality. The municipality shall remain as a small town, thus Burgos has adopted the same as its settlement goal until the end of the planning period.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.3. Population</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It has been projected that the municipality’s population will increase to 20,995 people by 2022. This population increase demands that the municipality provides more infrastructure facilities and services to address population demands.&nbsp; Apart from that, the provision of the needed land requirement to accommodate the population surplus as well as the observed informal settlements should be taken into account.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.4.

Alternative 1: Agro-commercial development strategy (Natural Growth Pattern)</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Agricultural growth coupled with commercialization is already the trend in the municipality that coincides with what may be seen as the natural growth pattern that intends to followpast trends.&nbsp; The plan involves letting the urban area and other population centers develop following their natural tendency.&nbsp; Minimal local government intervention is required in implementing this type of development.The primary interventions shall be in protecting prime agricultural areas and providing agricultural support facilities and services. This shall be combined with efforts to increase access to markets through commercialization. Following the natural growth pattern, services and opportunities shall be concentrated in the barangays of the Poblacion and other areas such as the barangay of Pogoruac. Settlements and their support activities shall be developed along the existing major transportation and communication routes. (See Map No. 3, Natural Growth Pattern Map). Maintenance and upgrading of these primary routes shall be done to ensure mobility and to enhance accessibility.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The advantage of this form of development is the decongestion of the sole urban barangay of Burgos. It also means maximizing the use of the major road trunk line.&nbsp; In the long run however, this development plan tends to result in land use patterns that undermine the feasibility and opportunity of designing urban development in potential expansion areas.&nbsp; At the same time, it accelerates the conversion of prime agricultural areas from which the residents derive their daily sustenance. Thus the long-term effect negates the initial advantages gained.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>2.2. Alternative 2: Rapid Commercio-Industrialization Strategy (Classic Stellar or Constellation Pattern)</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Still connected with the first alternative, this second development thrusts includes industrialization as a partner of commercialization. This strategy would require the putting up of support services, facilities and utilities that shall support industrial activities.&nbsp; This strategy takes advantage of the agri-business and agri-industrial potentials of the municipality to complement the agricultural sector. Intensified commercialization shall take the form of providing trading centers (primarily for livestock) highlighting the envisioned roleof the municipality as a livestock provider for the whole province. Industrial and commercial facilities shall be used to attract investments into the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This kind of development sees a spatial strategy corresponding to the Classic Stellar or Constellation Model which is based on Hoyt’stheory that urban growth and development tends to follow major transportation and communications routes radiating away from the urban core. Such a development aided by government regulation and intervention assumes the shape of a starfish whose limbs symbolize the radiating arms of development. Applied to Burgos, the Poblacion is to be targeted as the center of &nbsp;development. Growth impetus is expected to spread outwards to the peripheral barangays along the major trunk lines. The concept, therefore, approximates a regulated form of the natural growth model but is also is be-saddled by that model’s negative collateral consequences.The main limitation of this model is that it makes no reference to out of town development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This model takes into account the observation that it is common for households to be near road lines, and commercial establishments to be along business thoroughfares. Recognizing that the various transportation routes into an urban area represented greater access, cities tended to grow in wedge-shaped patterns -- or sectors -- emanating from the central business district and centered on major transportation routes. Higher levels of access meant higher land values, thus, many commercial functions would remain in the central business district (the Poblacion) but manufacturing functions would develop in a wedge surrounding transportation routes. Residential functions would grow in wedge-shaped patterns.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Map No. 4, Classic Stellar Map, illustrates the Classic Stellar or Constellation model for Burgos.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3.

Land as Location</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This concept considers the factor of land as a point in space wherein relative distance to other locations of different variables in spaces is studied.&nbsp; Location is a major factor affecting the value and uses of land.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>c. Land as Property</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This concept considers the ownership rights of individuals and/or groups.&nbsp; Within the context of the development proposals, the ownership right to use land as property is subjected to the regulations of the state for the purposes of general welfare and the optimum and efficient use of land as a resource.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3.1.2. Concepts and Principles in Land Use Planning</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>a. High/Best/Optimum Use</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Land is considered at its highest and optimum use when its use is for the purpose or combination of purposes, and in which it has the highest comparative advantage, or the least comparative disadvantage relative to other uses.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>b. Compatible Use</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A land use is considered compatible of said use if it could be in harmony with uses of land adjacent to the subject land use and/or to the dominant land use within the vicinity of subject land use.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>c. Land as limited fixed resource and as such must be managed for the welfare, and in accordance to the community’s operation as reflected in their development plan.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>d. The environment provides man with life supporting system and as such it shall be conserved and developed to enhance the quality of life.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>e. Land must be used in the most beneficial, rational and most efficient manner so as to prevent the mixture of incompatible uses, environmental hazards, slight depletion and degradation of land resources.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>f. There is a need for regulatory measures to promote the desired pattern of land use as proposed in this Comprehensive Land Use Plan.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>g. The concept of Hierarchy of Settlements</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Settlements naturally develop in varying degrees could be categorized into a hierarchical order of functions.&nbsp; Said natural development trends could, however be altered by planning efforts to effect the desired and efficient distribution of the hierarchical order of functions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>h. Growth Center Strategy</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This physical development strategy considers the situation with limited resources and the possible situation of such limited resources not efficiently distributed in land as space.&nbsp; Due to this situation, levels and types of growth centers are identified and located equitably as focal delivery points for specific types of services, facilities and resource opportunities to serve the designated influence area in an efficient manner.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>i. Concentric Development</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This physical development strategy takes into consideration the dispersal of activities within an urban core or center by expanding on the areas contiguous to, or adjacent to and beyond that core.&nbsp; The immediate and outer peripheries of the urban core are identified as the expansion area of urban growth and development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>j. Linear or Strip Development</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This physical development strategy follows trends that urban development form along major routes or trunk lines for transportation and communication.&nbsp; It is aimed to develop new hubs of economic activities along the major routes to disperse effects to its outlying areas.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>k. Central and Nodal Development</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This development concept follows a certain hierarchy of functions and sizes.&nbsp; The central point of activity is focused on the identified major growth center supported by growth nodes around it. It is assumed that the major growth center shall provide specialized facilities and services, which shall trickle out to the growth nodes.&nbsp; It also serves as the external link of the municipality to other municipalities and cities.&nbsp; The nodes, on the other hand, provide support to the major growth center as its captive market of both labor and resources, and at the same time disperse development services to its influence areas.&nbsp; An efficient circulation system is required to achieve complementarity of the major growth center and the nodes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3.2.&nbsp; Structure Plan</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The following structure plan is based on the preferred development strategy of Burgos described as<strong><em>agro-commercio-industrial &amp;agri-tourism management strategy</em></strong>. The structure plan, on the other hand is described as the <strong><em>Multi-Point Scenic Agricultural Development Model</em></strong>. The strategic plan makes a case for the preservation of the agricultural character of Burgos arguing that the municipality may be developed as a showcase agricultural community supported by agriculture-based commerce and industry, facilitated by its connectivity to other areas within the province via the road network, and guided by an aspiration to preserve its agricultural character.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This development plan lends a strong support for economic development that retains Burgos’ agricultural character and protects its important natural resources and pristine environment. Development in Burgos should maintain the quality of life of its people provided by a landscape dominated by farming, resource preservation, scenic areas and many opportunities for outdoor activities, while supporting the harvesting of agricultural products and other land based economic development. In keeping with this image, traditional economic growth should be encouraged in areas where infrastructure already exists or may be easily extended in order to minimize environmental degradation and haphazard transformation of the municipality’s character.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The said strategy is depicted in the following diagramand presented in the Structure/Concept Plan Map (See Map No. 5 and figure 3).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The diagram illustrates the preferred land use strategy of Burgos which tries to embody the harmony between agriculture-led development and the preservation of the agricultural town character of Burgos, hence the notion of&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>“<em>scenic agricultural development</em>.”</strong> While economic development via agriculture is the goal, the strategy aims to achieve this goal together with proper management of land uses that preserves the countryside character of the municipality. This is done, as shown in the diagram, through the interplay of three main “<strong><em>land use development blocks”</em></strong>or areasin the municipality, namely: (1) the commercial blocks, (2) agricultural blocks and (3) scenic blocks. Land uses in these areas are to be guided by the characteristics sought to be preserved in these blocks as described below. Zoning is thus understood in its ecological sense of designating areas with a distinct or characteristic system determined largely by its environment. Designated by translucent areas in the diagram (red for commercial blocks, green for agricultural blocks and light green scenic blocks), these blocks signify how artificial boundaries in the municipality’s land uses are transcended through the integration of space.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In order to orchestrate development in these blocks, the model calls for the designation of components of a system that may be designated as specific points of intervention or as the designated components of a multi-point approach resting on the identification of strategic barangays in the municipality. Instead of concentrating on one or two barangays as points of development, the model advocates systematically distributing development efforts in several barangays or “<strong><em>multi-points of growth</em></strong>.”&nbsp; Designated as growth points, these points are identified to provide the impetus for development in agriculture and agro-forestry, commerce and industry, and tourism. Encouraging economic activities in these multiple points will help reduce the likelihood of haphazard strip development along existing roads which may, above all, work to destroy the agricultural character of the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:table -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Figure 3&nbsp;&nbsp; : MULTI-POINT SCENIC AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT MODEL</strong><strong></strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong></strong> Scenic Blocks (Forest/Pasture) Agri-Commercial Point (Poblacion&amp; Adjacent barangays) Agri-ScenicPoints (Concordia-Sapa Grande- Sapa Pequena) &nbsp; Agricultural Blocks (Farmlands) Agri-Forest &amp;Mariculture Points (Ilio-ilio &amp; Cacayasen) Agri-TourismPoint (Cabongaoan Beach, Ilio-ilio) Commercial &amp; Industrial Blocks &nbsp; &nbsp; Potential Coastal Road Agri-Industrial Point (Pogoruac/Papallasen)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n<!-- /wp:table -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>a. The Land Use Development Blocks</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This strategy takes-off from the observation that Burgos has acquired an agricultural character through development that has kept large portions of the municipality in unsullied conditions. This plan focuses on amplifying and riding on this characteristic which can be presented as the specific difference Burgos. The rural agricultural character of Burgos exists due to the scenic vistas, large uninterrupted farmlands and pasturelands, forested areas, and limited and scattered development along the roads. This agricultural character should be of importance in planning for the municipality.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The agricultural character of Burgos may be evaluated from three perspectives represented by the three land-use-development-blocks- (1) the scenic blocks, (2) the agricultural block, and (3) the commercial blocks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Scenic Block</em>s</strong> are conceived from the vantage point of the road connecting the Poblacion to Ilio-ilio. The scenic blocks are to be characterized by views of fairly open areas adjacent to farmlands. More distant views of forested ridgelines shall also be highlighted. The several large farms along the road network shall add to the scenic agricultural character of the municipality. Scattered single family dwellings, some newer and some historic, located along the roadshall be kept. These views should be consciously protected in planning. The municipal protected areas should therefore include those areas within the forestry, pastureland and farmlands.&nbsp; Proper planning and zoning should allow the protection of these areas without limiting economic development through conservation easements. Basically, this should mean that the scenic views will be afforded some level of protection from indiscriminate development. It should be noted that many of the unprotected areas in Burgos are open fields and farms where future development would be highly visible. Development along the roads needs to preserve the open fields and farms and provide a visual and functional relationship of structures to the surrounding landscape. Development guidelines should be established to help protect the open fields along the scenic views from the road while still allowing controlled development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Commercial / Industrial Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the Poblacion and the national road network passing through the Poblacion which connotes a well-defined route along Burgos to the other municipalities in Western Pangasinan and the sites of agri-industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen. Thesecommercial areasareto be characterizedby mix of land uses with planned pockets of commercial areas, particularly in the Poblacion immediately adjacent barangays. The compact development of the Poblacion with its defined entry points and the fact that itserves as a center for local commercial and institutional activities defines its agricultural and commercial character. The sites of the industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be presented as areas for investments in industrial ventures. Development guidelines should allow and encourage the continuation of the village-style development in this area. Despite the commercialization to be allowed, economic development that promotes the viability of the working landscape should be designed along with forestry and agriculture-related enterprises that preserve the character of Burgos.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agricultural Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the productive agricultural lands in the Poblacion to San Vicente and San Miguel areas, as well as the agricultural areas in the western barangays of the municipality. The goal should be to stimulate appropriate economic development and provide opportunity for individuals to establish agriculture-based ventures in these areas. Economic development in the different barangays should reinforce traditional settlement patterns, protect the agricultural character of the municipality and revitalize village and growth centers. This plan therefore declares that the best interest of Burgos is to see to it that new development occurs in amanner that does not change the basic land use patterns, and consequently the character of Burgos. Therefore, the multiple points identified to function as growth centers below should be the focus for mixed-use, higher intensity development and new growth.&nbsp; Outlying areas should be designed and managed so as not to compromise the agricultural character of Burgos or its important natural resources.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>b. The Multi-Points of Growth</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The identified growth points are: (1) the Agri-Commercial points (i.e., the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac), (2) the Agri-InustriaLpoints (the barangays of PogoruacandPapallasen), (3) the Agri-Forest Mariculture points (i.e., the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen), (4) the Agri-Scenic points (i.e., the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena), and (5) the Agri-Tourism point (i.e., Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio). Calling these growth points by names prefixed by “agriculture” (i.e., Agri) emphasizes the role that agriculture is supposed to play in shaping the development of Burgos in combination with&nbsp; commerce and industry, fishing and aquaculture, tourism, and scenic management of the farmlands, forests and pasturelands.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The model advises that development interventions should be concentrated in these growth points while eventually seeing their effects on the other barangays. By deliberately planning changes in these growth points, harmonious changes in the three land-use-development-blocks are sought. Thus, the growth points are expected to generate further growth in surrounding barangays. The strategy aims to develop growth points as the foci for intervention.&nbsp; Apart from helping de-concentrate development away from the traditional centers, it is also designed to create new catchments for dispersing industry, commerce and people.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Commercial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate commercial activities by inducing entrepreneurs and investors to put up commercial shops and outlets in the Poblacion’s central business district and Pogoruac as the alternative commercial growth center in the opposite end of the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Industrial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate industrial activities primarily stemming from the invitation for industrial venture investments in two industrial hubs in the two said barangays.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Forest Mariculture Points</em></strong> are set in the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen. Both Ilio-ilo and Cacayasen are the sites forests areas Burgos. With the aim of expanding the protected forests in the municipality, these two barangays shall be the centers of forest management efforts.&nbsp; Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen are also the sites of substantial fishing activities. The coastal Ilio-ilio produces marine catch for local consumption while Cacayasen, with its fishponds is strategically the most favorable area for aquaculture since it is a low lying area where water is retained in natural and artificial ponds. This inherent geographical characteristic of the barangay which may render it non-conducive to farming and raising livestock warrants planning to developing it as a zone for aquaculture.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Scenic Points</em></strong> shall be the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena. Spatially, these three barangays form a belt which is transected by the road network. These three barangays, will serve as sections of the municipality’s transportation and utility corridor. Planning in these barangays should maximize productive land use without severing farm units while facilitating access for producers and harvesters. Guided by the goal of preserving the scenic stretches along the route, every effort should be made to avoid impairment of agricultural lands as well as the pasturelands. Proper planning in these barangays will ensure that the transportation and utility corridor will be managed carefully in the context of the agricultural lands and uses through which it passes. The transportation facilities should complement and serve, rather than harm the municipality’s farmlands, pastureland and agriculture industry through which they pass.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Tourism Point</em></strong> is the Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio. Cabongaoan shall serve as the end-point of a tourism destination which should include the whole of the municipality- branded as “scenic agricultural tourism.” This tourism concept is based on the design that the municipality can be presented as an agricultural community with distinct assets. Visitors can come in search of peaceful relaxation, inspiration, recreation, education and entertainment. Among the tourism assets of Burgos which can be the content of its marketing efforts should be its small town atmosphere, scenery, agricultural tourism, outdoor recreation, festivals and events, and&nbsp; environmental wonders culminating in its clean beach and coast&nbsp; in Cabongaoan.&nbsp; Thus, tourism in Burgos becomes not just an isolated activity in Cabongaoan but a municipality-wide promotion. Cabongaoan should be planned as the final destination at the end of the scenic corridor passing through the agricultural and scenic blocks of the municipality and as destination along the proposed coastal road of the province.&nbsp; To be effective, Cabongaoan should unify Burgos’ agricultural and rural community with beach tourism where functional and emotional benefits will be open to visitors. The whole of Burgos should therefore be considered as tourist destination and not only its beach.<strong><br></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'THE CONCEPT / STRUCTURE PLAN', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '109-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-09-13 11:46:19', '2020-09-13 11:46:19', '', 109, 'https://localhost/git/burgos-website/?p=138', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.1.&nbsp; Functional Role of the Municipality</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The municipality of Burgos is recognized as an agricultural and agro-industrial municipality.&nbsp; The Provincial Physical Framework Plan (PPFP) of the Province of Pangasinan classifies Burgos as a satellite growth center, being connected to surrounding municipalities. The central portion of the municipality is identified as a highly restricted agricultural area (HRAA). Thus Burgos is basically designated as an agricultural municipality making vital contributions to the agricultural and industrial development of the province. The PPFP does not mention any particular industries that can be the focus of development in the municipality. Forest lands for preservation are identified in the northernmost part while also mentioning the mangrove areas of Burgos. Reforestation, low susceptibility to landslides and flooding are noted. Among the concerns identified in the municipality are the need for socialized housing in view of its informal settlers, the need for a health service and water and sanitary facilities.&nbsp; The national road passing through Burgos is seen as an important factor that may affect development in the municipality. In like manner, the provincial road to Ilio-Ilio has been earmarked for conversion as national road. The proposed Dasol-Burgos-Agno-Bani-Bolinao coastal road has also been identified as a major intervention in the municipality. Mapped under the PPFP, Burgos is visualized basically for production land use with grazing, pasture and agricultural lands. In line with all these, the municipality of Burgos should be developed as an agricultural municipalityable to provide support for the other urban centers of the province given its strategic location.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.2. Settlement Type</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Burgos is considered in the Provincial Physical Framework Plan as a 4<sup>th</sup> &nbsp;class municipality. The municipality shall remain as a small town, thus Burgos has adopted the same as its settlement goal until the end of the planning period.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.3. Population</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It has been projected that the municipality’s population will increase to 20,995 people by 2022. This population increase demands that the municipality provides more infrastructure facilities and services to address population demands.&nbsp; Apart from that, the provision of the needed land requirement to accommodate the population surplus as well as the observed informal settlements should be taken into account.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.4.

This is planned in order to augment the expected profitable output of agricultural products.&nbsp; The principles and technology underlying the success of local government projects already put in place in the municipality shall be adopted to improve agricultural production and the processing of agricultural products.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>-Expansion of commercial activities</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Inducing entrepreneurs and investors to put up commercial shops and outlets in identified points in the municipality shall be emphasized. The upgrading of the existing commercial business district and the public market should be prioritized extending to stretches along the national highway. A satellite commercial district in the other end of the municipality should be developed.These commercial support facilities shall serve asalternative growth centers. The commercial focus of the municipality shall be further enhanced by marketing its central position to the other surrounding municipalities in the province.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>- Expansion of communication and transportation services</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The local government shall continue in efforts to establish moderntransportation and communication facilities and services tosupport economic revitalization.&nbsp; In order to speed up profitable economic transactions, the municipality shall provide for these facilities highlighting its connectivity with other municipalities. An area also targeted for expansion is the avenue of Internet access for all capable residents in order for them to be linked to the global information technology net. Transport activities along the major roads shall also be expanded.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>- Identification and advancement of tourism potentials</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Tourism shall be included in the thrusts of the municipality focused in its coastal areas.&nbsp; The tourism potentials of the municipality shall be roused by way of presenting the rural character of Burgos showcased along the major road network and connected to the coastal tourist attraction.&nbsp; Support facilities and activities shall be planned for and developed through specific tourism objectives on the coastal barangay radiating to adjacent barangays.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>- Promotion of Environmental Protection</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The maintenance of the natural resources of the municipality shall fostered by emphasizing scenic tourism and protection. Environmental protection programs shall be designed especially in the management of the limited forest resources of the municipality while keeping in mind the agricultural thrusts of the municipality. This shall be carried out through the laying down of appropriate plans.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>-&nbsp; Politico – Administrative machinery</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The development plans shall be spearheaded by vibrant politico-administrative machinery with appropriate and the entities tasked for implementation.&nbsp; Staffing pattern and reorganization pursuant to the Local Government Code, and the formulation of performance enhancement and evaluation systems to improve the delivery of basic services required by the growing population should be undertaken as early as the first year of the planning period.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>2.1. Alternative 1: Agro-commercial development strategy (Natural Growth Pattern)</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Agricultural growth coupled with commercialization is already the trend in the municipality that coincides with what may be seen as the natural growth pattern that intends to followpast trends.&nbsp; The plan involves letting the urban area and other population centers develop following their natural tendency.&nbsp; Minimal local government intervention is required in implementing this type of development.The primary interventions shall be in protecting prime agricultural areas and providing agricultural support facilities and services. This shall be combined with efforts to increase access to markets through commercialization. Following the natural growth pattern, services and opportunities shall be concentrated in the barangays of the Poblacion and other areas such as the barangay of Pogoruac. Settlements and their support activities shall be developed along the existing major transportation and communication routes. (See Map No. 3, Natural Growth Pattern Map). Maintenance and upgrading of these primary routes shall be done to ensure mobility and to enhance accessibility.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The advantage of this form of development is the decongestion of the sole urban barangay of Burgos. It also means maximizing the use of the major road trunk line.&nbsp; In the long run however, this development plan tends to result in land use patterns that undermine the feasibility and opportunity of designing urban development in potential expansion areas.&nbsp; At the same time, it accelerates the conversion of prime agricultural areas from which the residents derive their daily sustenance. Thus the long-term effect negates the initial advantages gained.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>2.2. Alternative 2: Rapid Commercio-Industrialization Strategy (Classic Stellar or Constellation Pattern)</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Still connected with the first alternative, this second development thrusts includes industrialization as a partner of commercialization. This strategy would require the putting up of support services, facilities and utilities that shall support industrial activities.&nbsp; This strategy takes advantage of the agri-business and agri-industrial potentials of the municipality to complement the agricultural sector. Intensified commercialization shall take the form of providing trading centers (primarily for livestock) highlighting the envisioned roleof the municipality as a livestock provider for the whole province. Industrial and commercial facilities shall be used to attract investments into the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This kind of development sees a spatial strategy corresponding to the Classic Stellar or Constellation Model which is based on Hoyt’stheory that urban growth and development tends to follow major transportation and communications routes radiating away from the urban core. Such a development aided by government regulation and intervention assumes the shape of a starfish whose limbs symbolize the radiating arms of development. Applied to Burgos, the Poblacion is to be targeted as the center of &nbsp;development. Growth impetus is expected to spread outwards to the peripheral barangays along the major trunk lines. The concept, therefore, approximates a regulated form of the natural growth model but is also is be-saddled by that model’s negative collateral consequences.The main limitation of this model is that it makes no reference to out of town development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This model takes into account the observation that it is common for households to be near road lines, and commercial establishments to be along business thoroughfares. Recognizing that the various transportation routes into an urban area represented greater access, cities tended to grow in wedge-shaped patterns -- or sectors -- emanating from the central business district and centered on major transportation routes. Higher levels of access meant higher land values, thus, many commercial functions would remain in the central business district (the Poblacion) but manufacturing functions would develop in a wedge surrounding transportation routes. Residential functions would grow in wedge-shaped patterns.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Map No. 4, Classic Stellar Map, illustrates the Classic Stellar or Constellation model for Burgos.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3. THE STRUCTURE PLAN</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The definitive development thrust chosen for Burgos has been guided, to a large extent, by the municipality’s formulated vision and mission which, in turn, shaped the goals and strategies formulated from the different sectoral studies. Thus, the &nbsp;Goals Achievement Matrix (GAM) was the main tool used in analyzing the different alternatives development thrusts for the municipality. This structure plan presents the chosen development thrust.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3.1.Physical Development Concepts and Strategies Utilized</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3.1.1. Planning Concepts on Land</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>a. Land as Space</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Land as form and space is where life takes place and moves, making land a subject of various studies on geography, or the study of distribution of variables in land as space.&nbsp; As a space, land is deemed fixed in area.&nbsp; Only in exceptional cases does land increase in area such as reclamation.&nbsp; As a space, Land is occupied and utilized for various purposes usually in increasing requirements.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>b. Land as Location</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This concept considers the factor of land as a point in space wherein relative distance to other locations of different variables in spaces is studied.&nbsp; Location is a major factor affecting the value and uses of land.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>c. Land as Property</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This concept considers the ownership rights of individuals and/or groups.&nbsp; Within the context of the development proposals, the ownership right to use land as property is subjected to the regulations of the state for the purposes of general welfare and the optimum and efficient use of land as a resource.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3.1.2. Concepts and Principles in Land Use Planning</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>a. High/Best/Optimum Use</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Land is considered at its highest and optimum use when its use is for the purpose or combination of purposes, and in which it has the highest comparative advantage, or the least comparative disadvantage relative to other uses.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>b. Compatible Use</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A land use is considered compatible of said use if it could be in harmony with uses of land adjacent to the subject land use and/or to the dominant land use within the vicinity of subject land use.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>c. Land as limited fixed resource and as such must be managed for the welfare, and in accordance to the community’s operation as reflected in their development plan.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>d. The environment provides man with life supporting system and as such it shall be conserved and developed to enhance the quality of life.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>e. Land must be used in the most beneficial, rational and most efficient manner so as to prevent the mixture of incompatible uses, environmental hazards, slight depletion and degradation of land resources.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>f. There is a need for regulatory measures to promote the desired pattern of land use as proposed in this Comprehensive Land Use Plan.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>g. The concept of Hierarchy of Settlements</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Settlements naturally develop in varying degrees could be categorized into a hierarchical order of functions.&nbsp; Said natural development trends could, however be altered by planning efforts to effect the desired and efficient distribution of the hierarchical order of functions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>h. Growth Center Strategy</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This physical development strategy considers the situation with limited resources and the possible situation of such limited resources not efficiently distributed in land as space.&nbsp; Due to this situation, levels and types of growth centers are identified and located equitably as focal delivery points for specific types of services, facilities and resource opportunities to serve the designated influence area in an efficient manner.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>i. Concentric Development</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This physical development strategy takes into consideration the dispersal of activities within an urban core or center by expanding on the areas contiguous to, or adjacent to and beyond that core.&nbsp; The immediate and outer peripheries of the urban core are identified as the expansion area of urban growth and development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>j. Linear or Strip Development</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This physical development strategy follows trends that urban development form along major routes or trunk lines for transportation and communication.&nbsp; It is aimed to develop new hubs of economic activities along the major routes to disperse effects to its outlying areas.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>k. Central and Nodal Development</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This development concept follows a certain hierarchy of functions and sizes.&nbsp; The central point of activity is focused on the identified major growth center supported by growth nodes around it. It is assumed that the major growth center shall provide specialized facilities and services, which shall trickle out to the growth nodes.&nbsp; It also serves as the external link of the municipality to other municipalities and cities.&nbsp; The nodes, on the other hand, provide support to the major growth center as its captive market of both labor and resources, and at the same time disperse development services to its influence areas.&nbsp; An efficient circulation system is required to achieve complementarity of the major growth center and the nodes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3.2.&nbsp; Structure Plan</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The following structure plan is based on the preferred development strategy of Burgos described as<strong><em>agro-commercio-industrial &amp;agri-tourism management strategy</em></strong>. The structure plan, on the other hand is described as the <strong><em>Multi-Point Scenic Agricultural Development Model</em></strong>. The strategic plan makes a case for the preservation of the agricultural character of Burgos arguing that the municipality may be developed as a showcase agricultural community supported by agriculture-based commerce and industry, facilitated by its connectivity to other areas within the province via the road network, and guided by an aspiration to preserve its agricultural character.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This development plan lends a strong support for economic development that retains Burgos’ agricultural character and protects its important natural resources and pristine environment. Development in Burgos should maintain the quality of life of its people provided by a landscape dominated by farming, resource preservation, scenic areas and many opportunities for outdoor activities, while supporting the harvesting of agricultural products and other land based economic development. In keeping with this image, traditional economic growth should be encouraged in areas where infrastructure already exists or may be easily extended in order to minimize environmental degradation and haphazard transformation of the municipality’s character.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The said strategy is depicted in the following diagramand presented in the Structure/Concept Plan Map (See Map No. 5 and figure 3).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The diagram illustrates the preferred land use strategy of Burgos which tries to embody the harmony between agriculture-led development and the preservation of the agricultural town character of Burgos, hence the notion of&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>“<em>scenic agricultural development</em>.”</strong> While economic development via agriculture is the goal, the strategy aims to achieve this goal together with proper management of land uses that preserves the countryside character of the municipality. This is done, as shown in the diagram, through the interplay of three main “<strong><em>land use development blocks”</em></strong>or areasin the municipality, namely: (1) the commercial blocks, (2) agricultural blocks and (3) scenic blocks. Land uses in these areas are to be guided by the characteristics sought to be preserved in these blocks as described below. Zoning is thus understood in its ecological sense of designating areas with a distinct or characteristic system determined largely by its environment. Designated by translucent areas in the diagram (red for commercial blocks, green for agricultural blocks and light green scenic blocks), these blocks signify how artificial boundaries in the municipality’s land uses are transcended through the integration of space.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In order to orchestrate development in these blocks, the model calls for the designation of components of a system that may be designated as specific points of intervention or as the designated components of a multi-point approach resting on the identification of strategic barangays in the municipality. Instead of concentrating on one or two barangays as points of development, the model advocates systematically distributing development efforts in several barangays or “<strong><em>multi-points of growth</em></strong>.”&nbsp; Designated as growth points, these points are identified to provide the impetus for development in agriculture and agro-forestry, commerce and industry, and tourism. Encouraging economic activities in these multiple points will help reduce the likelihood of haphazard strip development along existing roads which may, above all, work to destroy the agricultural character of the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:table -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Figure 3&nbsp;&nbsp; : MULTI-POINT SCENIC AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT MODEL</strong><strong></strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong></strong> Scenic Blocks (Forest/Pasture) Agri-Commercial Point (Poblacion&amp; Adjacent barangays) Agri-ScenicPoints (Concordia-Sapa Grande- Sapa Pequena) &nbsp; Agricultural Blocks (Farmlands) Agri-Forest &amp;Mariculture Points (Ilio-ilio &amp; Cacayasen) Agri-TourismPoint (Cabongaoan Beach, Ilio-ilio) Commercial &amp; Industrial Blocks &nbsp; &nbsp; Potential Coastal Road Agri-Industrial Point (Pogoruac/Papallasen)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n<!-- /wp:table -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>a. The Land Use Development Blocks</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This strategy takes-off from the observation that Burgos has acquired an agricultural character through development that has kept large portions of the municipality in unsullied conditions. This plan focuses on amplifying and riding on this characteristic which can be presented as the specific difference Burgos. The rural agricultural character of Burgos exists due to the scenic vistas, large uninterrupted farmlands and pasturelands, forested areas, and limited and scattered development along the roads. This agricultural character should be of importance in planning for the municipality.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The agricultural character of Burgos may be evaluated from three perspectives represented by the three land-use-development-blocks- (1) the scenic blocks, (2) the agricultural block, and (3) the commercial blocks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Scenic Block</em>s</strong> are conceived from the vantage point of the road connecting the Poblacion to Ilio-ilio. The scenic blocks are to be characterized by views of fairly open areas adjacent to farmlands. More distant views of forested ridgelines shall also be highlighted. The several large farms along the road network shall add to the scenic agricultural character of the municipality. Scattered single family dwellings, some newer and some historic, located along the roadshall be kept. These views should be consciously protected in planning. The municipal protected areas should therefore include those areas within the forestry, pastureland and farmlands.&nbsp; Proper planning and zoning should allow the protection of these areas without limiting economic development through conservation easements. Basically, this should mean that the scenic views will be afforded some level of protection from indiscriminate development. It should be noted that many of the unprotected areas in Burgos are open fields and farms where future development would be highly visible. Development along the roads needs to preserve the open fields and farms and provide a visual and functional relationship of structures to the surrounding landscape. Development guidelines should be established to help protect the open fields along the scenic views from the road while still allowing controlled development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Commercial / Industrial Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the Poblacion and the national road network passing through the Poblacion which connotes a well-defined route along Burgos to the other municipalities in Western Pangasinan and the sites of agri-industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen. Thesecommercial areasareto be characterizedby mix of land uses with planned pockets of commercial areas, particularly in the Poblacion immediately adjacent barangays. The compact development of the Poblacion with its defined entry points and the fact that itserves as a center for local commercial and institutional activities defines its agricultural and commercial character. The sites of the industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be presented as areas for investments in industrial ventures. Development guidelines should allow and encourage the continuation of the village-style development in this area. Despite the commercialization to be allowed, economic development that promotes the viability of the working landscape should be designed along with forestry and agriculture-related enterprises that preserve the character of Burgos.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agricultural Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the productive agricultural lands in the Poblacion to San Vicente and San Miguel areas, as well as the agricultural areas in the western barangays of the municipality. The goal should be to stimulate appropriate economic development and provide opportunity for individuals to establish agriculture-based ventures in these areas. Economic development in the different barangays should reinforce traditional settlement patterns, protect the agricultural character of the municipality and revitalize village and growth centers. This plan therefore declares that the best interest of Burgos is to see to it that new development occurs in amanner that does not change the basic land use patterns, and consequently the character of Burgos. Therefore, the multiple points identified to function as growth centers below should be the focus for mixed-use, higher intensity development and new growth.&nbsp; Outlying areas should be designed and managed so as not to compromise the agricultural character of Burgos or its important natural resources.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>b. The Multi-Points of Growth</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The identified growth points are: (1) the Agri-Commercial points (i.e., the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac), (2) the Agri-InustriaLpoints (the barangays of PogoruacandPapallasen), (3) the Agri-Forest Mariculture points (i.e., the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen), (4) the Agri-Scenic points (i.e., the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena), and (5) the Agri-Tourism point (i.e., Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio). Calling these growth points by names prefixed by “agriculture” (i.e., Agri) emphasizes the role that agriculture is supposed to play in shaping the development of Burgos in combination with&nbsp; commerce and industry, fishing and aquaculture, tourism, and scenic management of the farmlands, forests and pasturelands.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The model advises that development interventions should be concentrated in these growth points while eventually seeing their effects on the other barangays. By deliberately planning changes in these growth points, harmonious changes in the three land-use-development-blocks are sought. Thus, the growth points are expected to generate further growth in surrounding barangays. The strategy aims to develop growth points as the foci for intervention.&nbsp; Apart from helping de-concentrate development away from the traditional centers, it is also designed to create new catchments for dispersing industry, commerce and people.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Commercial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate commercial activities by inducing entrepreneurs and investors to put up commercial shops and outlets in the Poblacion’s central business district and Pogoruac as the alternative commercial growth center in the opposite end of the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Industrial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate industrial activities primarily stemming from the invitation for industrial venture investments in two industrial hubs in the two said barangays.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Forest Mariculture Points</em></strong> are set in the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen. Both Ilio-ilo and Cacayasen are the sites forests areas Burgos. With the aim of expanding the protected forests in the municipality, these two barangays shall be the centers of forest management efforts.&nbsp; Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen are also the sites of substantial fishing activities. The coastal Ilio-ilio produces marine catch for local consumption while Cacayasen, with its fishponds is strategically the most favorable area for aquaculture since it is a low lying area where water is retained in natural and artificial ponds. This inherent geographical characteristic of the barangay which may render it non-conducive to farming and raising livestock warrants planning to developing it as a zone for aquaculture.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Scenic Points</em></strong> shall be the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena. Spatially, these three barangays form a belt which is transected by the road network. These three barangays, will serve as sections of the municipality’s transportation and utility corridor. Planning in these barangays should maximize productive land use without severing farm units while facilitating access for producers and harvesters. Guided by the goal of preserving the scenic stretches along the route, every effort should be made to avoid impairment of agricultural lands as well as the pasturelands. Proper planning in these barangays will ensure that the transportation and utility corridor will be managed carefully in the context of the agricultural lands and uses through which it passes. The transportation facilities should complement and serve, rather than harm the municipality’s farmlands, pastureland and agriculture industry through which they pass.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Tourism Point</em></strong> is the Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio. Cabongaoan shall serve as the end-point of a tourism destination which should include the whole of the municipality- branded as “scenic agricultural tourism.” This tourism concept is based on the design that the municipality can be presented as an agricultural community with distinct assets. Visitors can come in search of peaceful relaxation, inspiration, recreation, education and entertainment. Among the tourism assets of Burgos which can be the content of its marketing efforts should be its small town atmosphere, scenery, agricultural tourism, outdoor recreation, festivals and events, and&nbsp; environmental wonders culminating in its clean beach and coast&nbsp; in Cabongaoan.&nbsp; Thus, tourism in Burgos becomes not just an isolated activity in Cabongaoan but a municipality-wide promotion. Cabongaoan should be planned as the final destination at the end of the scenic corridor passing through the agricultural and scenic blocks of the municipality and as destination along the proposed coastal road of the province.&nbsp; To be effective, Cabongaoan should unify Burgos’ agricultural and rural community with beach tourism where functional and emotional benefits will be open to visitors. The whole of Burgos should therefore be considered as tourist destination and not only its beach.<strong><br></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'THE CONCEPT / STRUCTURE PLAN', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '109-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-09-13 11:54:28', '2020-09-13 11:54:28', '', 109, 'https://localhost/git/burgos-website/?p=139', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.1.&nbsp; Functional Role of the Municipality</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The municipality of Burgos is recognized as an agricultural and agro-industrial municipality.&nbsp; The Provincial Physical Framework Plan (PPFP) of the Province of Pangasinan classifies Burgos as a satellite growth center, being connected to surrounding municipalities. The central portion of the municipality is identified as a highly restricted agricultural area (HRAA). Thus Burgos is basically designated as an agricultural municipality making vital contributions to the agricultural and industrial development of the province. The PPFP does not mention any particular industries that can be the focus of development in the municipality. Forest lands for preservation are identified in the northernmost part while also mentioning the mangrove areas of Burgos. Reforestation, low susceptibility to landslides and flooding are noted. Among the concerns identified in the municipality are the need for socialized housing in view of its informal settlers, the need for a health service and water and sanitary facilities.&nbsp; The national road passing through Burgos is seen as an important factor that may affect development in the municipality. In like manner, the provincial road to Ilio-Ilio has been earmarked for conversion as national road. The proposed Dasol-Burgos-Agno-Bani-Bolinao coastal road has also been identified as a major intervention in the municipality. Mapped under the PPFP, Burgos is visualized basically for production land use with grazing, pasture and agricultural lands. In line with all these, the municipality of Burgos should be developed as an agricultural municipalityable to provide support for the other urban centers of the province given its strategic location.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.2. Settlement Type</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Burgos is considered in the Provincial Physical Framework Plan as a 4<sup>th</sup> &nbsp;class municipality. The municipality shall remain as a small town, thus Burgos has adopted the same as its settlement goal until the end of the planning period.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.3. Population</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It has been projected that the municipality’s population will increase to 20,995 people by 2022. This population increase demands that the municipality provides more infrastructure facilities and services to address population demands.&nbsp; Apart from that, the provision of the needed land requirement to accommodate the population surplus as well as the observed informal settlements should be taken into account.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.4.

This is planned in order to augment the expected profitable output of agricultural products.&nbsp; The principles and technology underlying the success of local government projects already put in place in the municipality shall be adopted to improve agricultural production and the processing of agricultural products.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>-Expansion of commercial activities</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Inducing entrepreneurs and investors to put up commercial shops and outlets in identified points in the municipality shall be emphasized. The upgrading of the existing commercial business district and the public market should be prioritized extending to stretches along the national highway. A satellite commercial district in the other end of the municipality should be developed.These commercial support facilities shall serve asalternative growth centers. The commercial focus of the municipality shall be further enhanced by marketing its central position to the other surrounding municipalities in the province.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>- Expansion of communication and transportation services</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The local government shall continue in efforts to establish moderntransportation and communication facilities and services tosupport economic revitalization.&nbsp; In order to speed up profitable economic transactions, the municipality shall provide for these facilities highlighting its connectivity with other municipalities. An area also targeted for expansion is the avenue of Internet access for all capable residents in order for them to be linked to the global information technology net. Transport activities along the major roads shall also be expanded.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>- Identification and advancement of tourism potentials</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Tourism shall be included in the thrusts of the municipality focused in its coastal areas.&nbsp; The tourism potentials of the municipality shall be roused by way of presenting the rural character of Burgos showcased along the major road network and connected to the coastal tourist attraction.&nbsp; Support facilities and activities shall be planned for and developed through specific tourism objectives on the coastal barangay radiating to adjacent barangays.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>- Promotion of Environmental Protection</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The maintenance of the natural resources of the municipality shall fostered by emphasizing scenic tourism and protection. Environmental protection programs shall be designed especially in the management of the limited forest resources of the municipality while keeping in mind the agricultural thrusts of the municipality. This shall be carried out through the laying down of appropriate plans.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>-&nbsp; Politico – Administrative machinery</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The development plans shall be spearheaded by vibrant politico-administrative machinery with appropriate and the entities tasked for implementation.&nbsp; Staffing pattern and reorganization pursuant to the Local Government Code, and the formulation of performance enhancement and evaluation systems to improve the delivery of basic services required by the growing population should be undertaken as early as the first year of the planning period.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>2.1. Alternative 1: Agro-commercial development strategy (Natural Growth Pattern)</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Agricultural growth coupled with commercialization is already the trend in the municipality that coincides with what may be seen as the natural growth pattern that intends to followpast trends.&nbsp; The plan involves letting the urban area and other population centers develop following their natural tendency.&nbsp; Minimal local government intervention is required in implementing this type of development.The primary interventions shall be in protecting prime agricultural areas and providing agricultural support facilities and services. This shall be combined with efforts to increase access to markets through commercialization. Following the natural growth pattern, services and opportunities shall be concentrated in the barangays of the Poblacion and other areas such as the barangay of Pogoruac. Settlements and their support activities shall be developed along the existing major transportation and communication routes. (See Map No. 3, Natural Growth Pattern Map). Maintenance and upgrading of these primary routes shall be done to ensure mobility and to enhance accessibility.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The advantage of this form of development is the decongestion of the sole urban barangay of Burgos. It also means maximizing the use of the major road trunk line.&nbsp; In the long run however, this development plan tends to result in land use patterns that undermine the feasibility and opportunity of designing urban development in potential expansion areas.&nbsp; At the same time, it accelerates the conversion of prime agricultural areas from which the residents derive their daily sustenance. Thus the long-term effect negates the initial advantages gained.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>2.2. Alternative 2: Rapid Commercio-Industrialization Strategy (Classic Stellar or Constellation Pattern)</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Still connected with the first alternative, this second development thrusts includes industrialization as a partner of commercialization. This strategy would require the putting up of support services, facilities and utilities that shall support industrial activities.&nbsp; This strategy takes advantage of the agri-business and agri-industrial potentials of the municipality to complement the agricultural sector. Intensified commercialization shall take the form of providing trading centers (primarily for livestock) highlighting the envisioned roleof the municipality as a livestock provider for the whole province. Industrial and commercial facilities shall be used to attract investments into the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This kind of development sees a spatial strategy corresponding to the Classic Stellar or Constellation Model which is based on Hoyt’stheory that urban growth and development tends to follow major transportation and communications routes radiating away from the urban core. Such a development aided by government regulation and intervention assumes the shape of a starfish whose limbs symbolize the radiating arms of development. Applied to Burgos, the Poblacion is to be targeted as the center of &nbsp;development. Growth impetus is expected to spread outwards to the peripheral barangays along the major trunk lines. The concept, therefore, approximates a regulated form of the natural growth model but is also is be-saddled by that model’s negative collateral consequences.The main limitation of this model is that it makes no reference to out of town development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This model takes into account the observation that it is common for households to be near road lines, and commercial establishments to be along business thoroughfares. Recognizing that the various transportation routes into an urban area represented greater access, cities tended to grow in wedge-shaped patterns -- or sectors -- emanating from the central business district and centered on major transportation routes. Higher levels of access meant higher land values, thus, many commercial functions would remain in the central business district (the Poblacion) but manufacturing functions would develop in a wedge surrounding transportation routes. Residential functions would grow in wedge-shaped patterns.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Map No. 4, Classic Stellar Map, illustrates the Classic Stellar or Constellation model for Burgos.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3. THE STRUCTURE PLAN</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The definitive development thrust chosen for Burgos has been guided, to a large extent, by the municipality’s formulated vision and mission which, in turn, shaped the goals and strategies formulated from the different sectoral studies. Thus, the &nbsp;Goals Achievement Matrix (GAM) was the main tool used in analyzing the different alternatives development thrusts for the municipality. This structure plan presents the chosen development thrust.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3.1.Physical Development Concepts and Strategies Utilized</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3.1.1. Planning Concepts on Land</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>a. Land as Space</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Land as form and space is where life takes place and moves, making land a subject of various studies on geography, or the study of distribution of variables in land as space.&nbsp; As a space, land is deemed fixed in area.&nbsp; Only in exceptional cases does land increase in area such as reclamation.&nbsp; As a space, Land is occupied and utilized for various purposes usually in increasing requirements.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>b. Land as Location</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This concept considers the factor of land as a point in space wherein relative distance to other locations of different variables in spaces is studied.&nbsp; Location is a major factor affecting the value and uses of land.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>c. Land as Property</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This concept considers the ownership rights of individuals and/or groups.&nbsp; Within the context of the development proposals, the ownership right to use land as property is subjected to the regulations of the state for the purposes of general welfare and the optimum and efficient use of land as a resource.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3.1.2. Concepts and Principles in Land Use Planning</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>a. High/Best/Optimum Use</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Land is considered at its highest and optimum use when its use is for the purpose or combination of purposes, and in which it has the highest comparative advantage, or the least comparative disadvantage relative to other uses.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>b. Compatible Use</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A land use is considered compatible of said use if it could be in harmony with uses of land adjacent to the subject land use and/or to the dominant land use within the vicinity of subject land use.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>c. Land as limited fixed resource and as such must be managed for the welfare, and in accordance to the community’s operation as reflected in their development plan.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>d. The environment provides man with life supporting system and as such it shall be conserved and developed to enhance the quality of life.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>e. Land must be used in the most beneficial, rational and most efficient manner so as to prevent the mixture of incompatible uses, environmental hazards, slight depletion and degradation of land resources.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>f. There is a need for regulatory measures to promote the desired pattern of land use as proposed in this Comprehensive Land Use Plan.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>g. The concept of Hierarchy of Settlements</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Settlements naturally develop in varying degrees could be categorized into a hierarchical order of functions.&nbsp; Said natural development trends could, however be altered by planning efforts to effect the desired and efficient distribution of the hierarchical order of functions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>h. Growth Center Strategy</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This physical development strategy considers the situation with limited resources and the possible situation of such limited resources not efficiently distributed in land as space.&nbsp; Due to this situation, levels and types of growth centers are identified and located equitably as focal delivery points for specific types of services, facilities and resource opportunities to serve the designated influence area in an efficient manner.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>i. Concentric Development</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This physical development strategy takes into consideration the dispersal of activities within an urban core or center by expanding on the areas contiguous to, or adjacent to and beyond that core.&nbsp; The immediate and outer peripheries of the urban core are identified as the expansion area of urban growth and development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>j. Linear or Strip Development</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This physical development strategy follows trends that urban development form along major routes or trunk lines for transportation and communication.&nbsp; It is aimed to develop new hubs of economic activities along the major routes to disperse effects to its outlying areas.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>k. Central and Nodal Development</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This development concept follows a certain hierarchy of functions and sizes.&nbsp; The central point of activity is focused on the identified major growth center supported by growth nodes around it. It is assumed that the major growth center shall provide specialized facilities and services, which shall trickle out to the growth nodes.&nbsp; It also serves as the external link of the municipality to other municipalities and cities.&nbsp; The nodes, on the other hand, provide support to the major growth center as its captive market of both labor and resources, and at the same time disperse development services to its influence areas.&nbsp; An efficient circulation system is required to achieve complementarity of the major growth center and the nodes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3.2.&nbsp; Structure Plan</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The following structure plan is based on the preferred development strategy of Burgos described as<strong><em>agro-commercio-industrial &amp;agri-tourism management strategy</em></strong>. The structure plan, on the other hand is described as the <strong><em>Multi-Point Scenic Agricultural Development Model</em></strong>. The strategic plan makes a case for the preservation of the agricultural character of Burgos arguing that the municipality may be developed as a showcase agricultural community supported by agriculture-based commerce and industry, facilitated by its connectivity to other areas within the province via the road network, and guided by an aspiration to preserve its agricultural character.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This development plan lends a strong support for economic development that retains Burgos’ agricultural character and protects its important natural resources and pristine environment. Development in Burgos should maintain the quality of life of its people provided by a landscape dominated by farming, resource preservation, scenic areas and many opportunities for outdoor activities, while supporting the harvesting of agricultural products and other land based economic development. In keeping with this image, traditional economic growth should be encouraged in areas where infrastructure already exists or may be easily extended in order to minimize environmental degradation and haphazard transformation of the municipality’s character.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The said strategy is depicted in the following diagramand presented in the Structure/Concept Plan Map (See Map No. 5 and figure 3).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The diagram illustrates the preferred land use strategy of Burgos which tries to embody the harmony between agriculture-led development and the preservation of the agricultural town character of Burgos, hence the notion of&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>“<em>scenic agricultural development</em>.”</strong> While economic development via agriculture is the goal, the strategy aims to achieve this goal together with proper management of land uses that preserves the countryside character of the municipality. This is done, as shown in the diagram, through the interplay of three main “<strong><em>land use development blocks”</em></strong>or areasin the municipality, namely: (1) the commercial blocks, (2) agricultural blocks and (3) scenic blocks. Land uses in these areas are to be guided by the characteristics sought to be preserved in these blocks as described below. Zoning is thus understood in its ecological sense of designating areas with a distinct or characteristic system determined largely by its environment. Designated by translucent areas in the diagram (red for commercial blocks, green for agricultural blocks and light green scenic blocks), these blocks signify how artificial boundaries in the municipality’s land uses are transcended through the integration of space.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In order to orchestrate development in these blocks, the model calls for the designation of components of a system that may be designated as specific points of intervention or as the designated components of a multi-point approach resting on the identification of strategic barangays in the municipality. Instead of concentrating on one or two barangays as points of development, the model advocates systematically distributing development efforts in several barangays or “<strong><em>multi-points of growth</em></strong>.”&nbsp; Designated as growth points, these points are identified to provide the impetus for development in agriculture and agro-forestry, commerce and industry, and tourism. Encouraging economic activities in these multiple points will help reduce the likelihood of haphazard strip development along existing roads which may, above all, work to destroy the agricultural character of the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:table -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Figure 3&nbsp;&nbsp; : MULTI-POINT SCENIC AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT MODEL</strong><strong></strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong></strong> Scenic Blocks (Forest/Pasture) Agri-Commercial Point (Poblacion&amp; Adjacent barangays) Agri-ScenicPoints (Concordia-Sapa Grande- Sapa Pequena) &nbsp; Agricultural Blocks (Farmlands) Agri-Forest &amp;Mariculture Points (Ilio-ilio &amp; Cacayasen) Agri-TourismPoint (Cabongaoan Beach, Ilio-ilio) Commercial &amp; Industrial Blocks &nbsp; &nbsp; Potential Coastal Road Agri-Industrial Point (Pogoruac/Papallasen)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n<!-- /wp:table -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>a. The Land Use Development Blocks</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This strategy takes-off from the observation that Burgos has acquired an agricultural character through development that has kept large portions of the municipality in unsullied conditions. This plan focuses on amplifying and riding on this characteristic which can be presented as the specific difference Burgos. The rural agricultural character of Burgos exists due to the scenic vistas, large uninterrupted farmlands and pasturelands, forested areas, and limited and scattered development along the roads. This agricultural character should be of importance in planning for the municipality.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The agricultural character of Burgos may be evaluated from three perspectives represented by the three land-use-development-blocks- (1) the scenic blocks, (2) the agricultural block, and (3) the commercial blocks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Scenic Block</em>s</strong> are conceived from the vantage point of the road connecting the Poblacion to Ilio-ilio. The scenic blocks are to be characterized by views of fairly open areas adjacent to farmlands. More distant views of forested ridgelines shall also be highlighted. The several large farms along the road network shall add to the scenic agricultural character of the municipality. Scattered single family dwellings, some newer and some historic, located along the roadshall be kept. These views should be consciously protected in planning. The municipal protected areas should therefore include those areas within the forestry, pastureland and farmlands.&nbsp; Proper planning and zoning should allow the protection of these areas without limiting economic development through conservation easements. Basically, this should mean that the scenic views will be afforded some level of protection from indiscriminate development. It should be noted that many of the unprotected areas in Burgos are open fields and farms where future development would be highly visible. Development along the roads needs to preserve the open fields and farms and provide a visual and functional relationship of structures to the surrounding landscape. Development guidelines should be established to help protect the open fields along the scenic views from the road while still allowing controlled development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Commercial / Industrial Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the Poblacion and the national road network passing through the Poblacion which connotes a well-defined route along Burgos to the other municipalities in Western Pangasinan and the sites of agri-industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen. Thesecommercial areasareto be characterizedby mix of land uses with planned pockets of commercial areas, particularly in the Poblacion immediately adjacent barangays. The compact development of the Poblacion with its defined entry points and the fact that itserves as a center for local commercial and institutional activities defines its agricultural and commercial character. The sites of the industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be presented as areas for investments in industrial ventures. Development guidelines should allow and encourage the continuation of the village-style development in this area. Despite the commercialization to be allowed, economic development that promotes the viability of the working landscape should be designed along with forestry and agriculture-related enterprises that preserve the character of Burgos.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agricultural Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the productive agricultural lands in the Poblacion to San Vicente and San Miguel areas, as well as the agricultural areas in the western barangays of the municipality. The goal should be to stimulate appropriate economic development and provide opportunity for individuals to establish agriculture-based ventures in these areas. Economic development in the different barangays should reinforce traditional settlement patterns, protect the agricultural character of the municipality and revitalize village and growth centers. This plan therefore declares that the best interest of Burgos is to see to it that new development occurs in amanner that does not change the basic land use patterns, and consequently the character of Burgos. Therefore, the multiple points identified to function as growth centers below should be the focus for mixed-use, higher intensity development and new growth.&nbsp; Outlying areas should be designed and managed so as not to compromise the agricultural character of Burgos or its important natural resources.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>b. The Multi-Points of Growth</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The identified growth points are: (1) the Agri-Commercial points (i.e., the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac), (2) the Agri-InustriaLpoints (the barangays of PogoruacandPapallasen), (3) the Agri-Forest Mariculture points (i.e., the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen), (4) the Agri-Scenic points (i.e., the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena), and (5) the Agri-Tourism point (i.e., Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio). Calling these growth points by names prefixed by “agriculture” (i.e., Agri) emphasizes the role that agriculture is supposed to play in shaping the development of Burgos in combination with&nbsp; commerce and industry, fishing and aquaculture, tourism, and scenic management of the farmlands, forests and pasturelands.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The model advises that development interventions should be concentrated in these growth points while eventually seeing their effects on the other barangays. By deliberately planning changes in these growth points, harmonious changes in the three land-use-development-blocks are sought. Thus, the growth points are expected to generate further growth in surrounding barangays. The strategy aims to develop growth points as the foci for intervention.&nbsp; Apart from helping de-concentrate development away from the traditional centers, it is also designed to create new catchments for dispersing industry, commerce and people.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Commercial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate commercial activities by inducing entrepreneurs and investors to put up commercial shops and outlets in the Poblacion’s central business district and Pogoruac as the alternative commercial growth center in the opposite end of the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Industrial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate industrial activities primarily stemming from the invitation for industrial venture investments in two industrial hubs in the two said barangays.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Forest Mariculture Points</em></strong> are set in the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen. Both Ilio-ilo and Cacayasen are the sites forests areas Burgos. With the aim of expanding the protected forests in the municipality, these two barangays shall be the centers of forest management efforts.&nbsp; Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen are also the sites of substantial fishing activities. The coastal Ilio-ilio produces marine catch for local consumption while Cacayasen, with its fishponds is strategically the most favorable area for aquaculture since it is a low lying area where water is retained in natural and artificial ponds. This inherent geographical characteristic of the barangay which may render it non-conducive to farming and raising livestock warrants planning to developing it as a zone for aquaculture.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Scenic Points</em></strong> shall be the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena. Spatially, these three barangays form a belt which is transected by the road network. These three barangays, will serve as sections of the municipality’s transportation and utility corridor. Planning in these barangays should maximize productive land use without severing farm units while facilitating access for producers and harvesters. Guided by the goal of preserving the scenic stretches along the route, every effort should be made to avoid impairment of agricultural lands as well as the pasturelands. Proper planning in these barangays will ensure that the transportation and utility corridor will be managed carefully in the context of the agricultural lands and uses through which it passes. The transportation facilities should complement and serve, rather than harm the municipality’s farmlands, pastureland and agriculture industry through which they pass.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Tourism Point</em></strong> is the Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio. Cabongaoan shall serve as the end-point of a tourism destination which should include the whole of the municipality- branded as “scenic agricultural tourism.” This tourism concept is based on the design that the municipality can be presented as an agricultural community with distinct assets. Visitors can come in search of peaceful relaxation, inspiration, recreation, education and entertainment. Among the tourism assets of Burgos which can be the content of its marketing efforts should be its small town atmosphere, scenery, agricultural tourism, outdoor recreation, festivals and events, and&nbsp; environmental wonders culminating in its clean beach and coast&nbsp; in Cabongaoan.&nbsp; Thus, tourism in Burgos becomes not just an isolated activity in Cabongaoan but a municipality-wide promotion. Cabongaoan should be planned as the final destination at the end of the scenic corridor passing through the agricultural and scenic blocks of the municipality and as destination along the proposed coastal road of the province.&nbsp; To be effective, Cabongaoan should unify Burgos’ agricultural and rural community with beach tourism where functional and emotional benefits will be open to visitors. The whole of Burgos should therefore be considered as tourist destination and not only its beach.<strong><br></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'THE CONCEPT / STRUCTURE PLAN', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '109-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-09-13 12:30:57', '2020-09-13 12:30:57', '', 109, 'https://localhost/git/burgos-website/?p=141', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.1.&nbsp; Functional Role of the Municipality</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The municipality of Burgos is recognized as an agricultural and agro-industrial municipality.&nbsp; The Provincial Physical Framework Plan (PPFP) of the Province of Pangasinan classifies Burgos as a satellite growth center, being connected to surrounding municipalities. The central portion of the municipality is identified as a highly restricted agricultural area (HRAA). Thus Burgos is basically designated as an agricultural municipality making vital contributions to the agricultural and industrial development of the province. The PPFP does not mention any particular industries that can be the focus of development in the municipality. Forest lands for preservation are identified in the northernmost part while also mentioning the mangrove areas of Burgos. Reforestation, low susceptibility to landslides and flooding are noted. Among the concerns identified in the municipality are the need for socialized housing in view of its informal settlers, the need for a health service and water and sanitary facilities.&nbsp; The national road passing through Burgos is seen as an important factor that may affect development in the municipality. In like manner, the provincial road to Ilio-Ilio has been earmarked for conversion as national road. The proposed Dasol-Burgos-Agno-Bani-Bolinao coastal road has also been identified as a major intervention in the municipality. Mapped under the PPFP, Burgos is visualized basically for production land use with grazing, pasture and agricultural lands. In line with all these, the municipality of Burgos should be developed as an agricultural municipalityable to provide support for the other urban centers of the province given its strategic location.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.2. Settlement Type</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Burgos is considered in the Provincial Physical Framework Plan as a 4<sup>th</sup> &nbsp;class municipality.

Population</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It has been projected that the municipality’s population will increase to 20,995 people by 2022. This population increase demands that the municipality provides more infrastructure facilities and services to address population demands.&nbsp; Apart from that, the provision of the needed land requirement to accommodate the population surplus as well as the observed informal settlements should be taken into account.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.4.

Alternative 1: Agro-commercial development strategy (Natural Growth Pattern)</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Agricultural growth coupled with commercialization is already the trend in the municipality that coincides with what may be seen as the natural growth pattern that intends to followpast trends.&nbsp; The plan involves letting the urban area and other population centers develop following their natural tendency.&nbsp; Minimal local government intervention is required in implementing this type of development.The primary interventions shall be in protecting prime agricultural areas and providing agricultural support facilities and services. This shall be combined with efforts to increase access to markets through commercialization. Following the natural growth pattern, services and opportunities shall be concentrated in the barangays of the Poblacion and other areas such as the barangay of Pogoruac. Settlements and their support activities shall be developed along the existing major transportation and communication routes. (See Map No. 3, Natural Growth Pattern Map). Maintenance and upgrading of these primary routes shall be done to ensure mobility and to enhance accessibility.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The advantage of this form of development is the decongestion of the sole urban barangay of Burgos. It also means maximizing the use of the major road trunk line.&nbsp; In the long run however, this development plan tends to result in land use patterns that undermine the feasibility and opportunity of designing urban development in potential expansion areas.&nbsp; At the same time, it accelerates the conversion of prime agricultural areas from which the residents derive their daily sustenance. Thus the long-term effect negates the initial advantages gained.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>2.2. Alternative 2: Rapid Commercio-Industrialization Strategy (Classic Stellar or Constellation Pattern)</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Still connected with the first alternative, this second development thrusts includes industrialization as a partner of commercialization. This strategy would require the putting up of support services, facilities and utilities that shall support industrial activities.&nbsp; This strategy takes advantage of the agri-business and agri-industrial potentials of the municipality to complement the agricultural sector. Intensified commercialization shall take the form of providing trading centers (primarily for livestock) highlighting the envisioned roleof the municipality as a livestock provider for the whole province. Industrial and commercial facilities shall be used to attract investments into the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This kind of development sees a spatial strategy corresponding to the Classic Stellar or Constellation Model which is based on Hoyt’stheory that urban growth and development tends to follow major transportation and communications routes radiating away from the urban core. Such a development aided by government regulation and intervention assumes the shape of a starfish whose limbs symbolize the radiating arms of development. Applied to Burgos, the Poblacion is to be targeted as the center of &nbsp;development. Growth impetus is expected to spread outwards to the peripheral barangays along the major trunk lines. The concept, therefore, approximates a regulated form of the natural growth model but is also is be-saddled by that model’s negative collateral consequences.The main limitation of this model is that it makes no reference to out of town development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This model takes into account the observation that it is common for households to be near road lines, and commercial establishments to be along business thoroughfares. Recognizing that the various transportation routes into an urban area represented greater access, cities tended to grow in wedge-shaped patterns -- or sectors -- emanating from the central business district and centered on major transportation routes. Higher levels of access meant higher land values, thus, many commercial functions would remain in the central business district (the Poblacion) but manufacturing functions would develop in a wedge surrounding transportation routes. Residential functions would grow in wedge-shaped patterns.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Map No. 4, Classic Stellar Map, illustrates the Classic Stellar or Constellation model for Burgos.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3.

Planning Concepts on Land</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>a. Land as Space</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Land as form and space is where life takes place and moves, making land a subject of various studies on geography, or the study of distribution of variables in land as space.&nbsp; As a space, land is deemed fixed in area.&nbsp; Only in exceptional cases does land increase in area such as reclamation.&nbsp; As a space, Land is occupied and utilized for various purposes usually in increasing requirements.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>b. Land as Location</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This concept considers the factor of land as a point in space wherein relative distance to other locations of different variables in spaces is studied.&nbsp; Location is a major factor affecting the value and uses of land.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>c. Land as Property</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This concept considers the ownership rights of individuals and/or groups.&nbsp; Within the context of the development proposals, the ownership right to use land as property is subjected to the regulations of the state for the purposes of general welfare and the optimum and efficient use of land as a resource.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3.1.2. Concepts and Principles in Land Use Planning</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>a. High/Best/Optimum Use</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Land is considered at its highest and optimum use when its use is for the purpose or combination of purposes, and in which it has the highest comparative advantage, or the least comparative disadvantage relative to other uses.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>b. Compatible Use</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A land use is considered compatible of said use if it could be in harmony with uses of land adjacent to the subject land use and/or to the dominant land use within the vicinity of subject land use.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>c. Land as limited fixed resource and as such must be managed for the welfare, and in accordance to the community’s operation as reflected in their development plan.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>d. The environment provides man with life supporting system and as such it shall be conserved and developed to enhance the quality of life.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>e. Land must be used in the most beneficial, rational and most efficient manner so as to prevent the mixture of incompatible uses, environmental hazards, slight depletion and degradation of land resources.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>f. There is a need for regulatory measures to promote the desired pattern of land use as proposed in this Comprehensive Land Use Plan.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>g. The concept of Hierarchy of Settlements</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Settlements naturally develop in varying degrees could be categorized into a hierarchical order of functions.&nbsp; Said natural development trends could, however be altered by planning efforts to effect the desired and efficient distribution of the hierarchical order of functions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>h. Growth Center Strategy</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This physical development strategy considers the situation with limited resources and the possible situation of such limited resources not efficiently distributed in land as space.&nbsp; Due to this situation, levels and types of growth centers are identified and located equitably as focal delivery points for specific types of services, facilities and resource opportunities to serve the designated influence area in an efficient manner.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>i. Concentric Development</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This physical development strategy takes into consideration the dispersal of activities within an urban core or center by expanding on the areas contiguous to, or adjacent to and beyond that core.&nbsp; The immediate and outer peripheries of the urban core are identified as the expansion area of urban growth and development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>j. Linear or Strip Development</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This physical development strategy follows trends that urban development form along major routes or trunk lines for transportation and communication.&nbsp; It is aimed to develop new hubs of economic activities along the major routes to disperse effects to its outlying areas.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>k. Central and Nodal Development</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This development concept follows a certain hierarchy of functions and sizes.&nbsp; The central point of activity is focused on the identified major growth center supported by growth nodes around it. It is assumed that the major growth center shall provide specialized facilities and services, which shall trickle out to the growth nodes.&nbsp; It also serves as the external link of the municipality to other municipalities and cities.&nbsp; The nodes, on the other hand, provide support to the major growth center as its captive market of both labor and resources, and at the same time disperse development services to its influence areas.&nbsp; An efficient circulation system is required to achieve complementarity of the major growth center and the nodes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3.2.&nbsp; Structure Plan</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The following structure plan is based on the preferred development strategy of Burgos described as<strong><em>agro-commercio-industrial &amp;agri-tourism management strategy</em></strong>. The structure plan, on the other hand is described as the <strong><em>Multi-Point Scenic Agricultural Development Model</em></strong>. The strategic plan makes a case for the preservation of the agricultural character of Burgos arguing that the municipality may be developed as a showcase agricultural community supported by agriculture-based commerce and industry, facilitated by its connectivity to other areas within the province via the road network, and guided by an aspiration to preserve its agricultural character.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This development plan lends a strong support for economic development that retains Burgos’ agricultural character and protects its important natural resources and pristine environment. Development in Burgos should maintain the quality of life of its people provided by a landscape dominated by farming, resource preservation, scenic areas and many opportunities for outdoor activities, while supporting the harvesting of agricultural products and other land based economic development. In keeping with this image, traditional economic growth should be encouraged in areas where infrastructure already exists or may be easily extended in order to minimize environmental degradation and haphazard transformation of the municipality’s character.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The said strategy is depicted in the following diagramand presented in the Structure/Concept Plan Map (See Map No. 5 and figure 3).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The diagram illustrates the preferred land use strategy of Burgos which tries to embody the harmony between agriculture-led development and the preservation of the agricultural town character of Burgos, hence the notion of&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>“<em>scenic agricultural development</em>.”</strong> While economic development via agriculture is the goal, the strategy aims to achieve this goal together with proper management of land uses that preserves the countryside character of the municipality. This is done, as shown in the diagram, through the interplay of three main “<strong><em>land use development blocks”</em></strong>or areasin the municipality, namely: (1) the commercial blocks, (2) agricultural blocks and (3) scenic blocks. Land uses in these areas are to be guided by the characteristics sought to be preserved in these blocks as described below. Zoning is thus understood in its ecological sense of designating areas with a distinct or characteristic system determined largely by its environment. Designated by translucent areas in the diagram (red for commercial blocks, green for agricultural blocks and light green scenic blocks), these blocks signify how artificial boundaries in the municipality’s land uses are transcended through the integration of space.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In order to orchestrate development in these blocks, the model calls for the designation of components of a system that may be designated as specific points of intervention or as the designated components of a multi-point approach resting on the identification of strategic barangays in the municipality. Instead of concentrating on one or two barangays as points of development, the model advocates systematically distributing development efforts in several barangays or “<strong><em>multi-points of growth</em></strong>.”&nbsp; Designated as growth points, these points are identified to provide the impetus for development in agriculture and agro-forestry, commerce and industry, and tourism. Encouraging economic activities in these multiple points will help reduce the likelihood of haphazard strip development along existing roads which may, above all, work to destroy the agricultural character of the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:table -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Figure 3&nbsp;&nbsp; : MULTI-POINT SCENIC AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT MODEL</strong><strong></strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong></strong> Scenic Blocks (Forest/Pasture) Agri-Commercial Point (Poblacion&amp; Adjacent barangays) Agri-ScenicPoints (Concordia-Sapa Grande- Sapa Pequena) &nbsp; Agricultural Blocks (Farmlands) Agri-Forest &amp;Mariculture Points (Ilio-ilio &amp; Cacayasen) Agri-TourismPoint (Cabongaoan Beach, Ilio-ilio) Commercial &amp; Industrial Blocks &nbsp; &nbsp; Potential Coastal Road Agri-Industrial Point (Pogoruac/Papallasen)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n<!-- /wp:table -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>a. The Land Use Development Blocks</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This strategy takes-off from the observation that Burgos has acquired an agricultural character through development that has kept large portions of the municipality in unsullied conditions. This plan focuses on amplifying and riding on this characteristic which can be presented as the specific difference Burgos. The rural agricultural character of Burgos exists due to the scenic vistas, large uninterrupted farmlands and pasturelands, forested areas, and limited and scattered development along the roads. This agricultural character should be of importance in planning for the municipality.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The agricultural character of Burgos may be evaluated from three perspectives represented by the three land-use-development-blocks- (1) the scenic blocks, (2) the agricultural block, and (3) the commercial blocks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Scenic Block</em>s</strong> are conceived from the vantage point of the road connecting the Poblacion to Ilio-ilio. The scenic blocks are to be characterized by views of fairly open areas adjacent to farmlands. More distant views of forested ridgelines shall also be highlighted. The several large farms along the road network shall add to the scenic agricultural character of the municipality. Scattered single family dwellings, some newer and some historic, located along the roadshall be kept. These views should be consciously protected in planning. The municipal protected areas should therefore include those areas within the forestry, pastureland and farmlands.&nbsp; Proper planning and zoning should allow the protection of these areas without limiting economic development through conservation easements. Basically, this should mean that the scenic views will be afforded some level of protection from indiscriminate development. It should be noted that many of the unprotected areas in Burgos are open fields and farms where future development would be highly visible. Development along the roads needs to preserve the open fields and farms and provide a visual and functional relationship of structures to the surrounding landscape. Development guidelines should be established to help protect the open fields along the scenic views from the road while still allowing controlled development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Commercial / Industrial Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the Poblacion and the national road network passing through the Poblacion which connotes a well-defined route along Burgos to the other municipalities in Western Pangasinan and the sites of agri-industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen. Thesecommercial areasareto be characterizedby mix of land uses with planned pockets of commercial areas, particularly in the Poblacion immediately adjacent barangays. The compact development of the Poblacion with its defined entry points and the fact that itserves as a center for local commercial and institutional activities defines its agricultural and commercial character. The sites of the industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be presented as areas for investments in industrial ventures. Development guidelines should allow and encourage the continuation of the village-style development in this area. Despite the commercialization to be allowed, economic development that promotes the viability of the working landscape should be designed along with forestry and agriculture-related enterprises that preserve the character of Burgos.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agricultural Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the productive agricultural lands in the Poblacion to San Vicente and San Miguel areas, as well as the agricultural areas in the western barangays of the municipality. The goal should be to stimulate appropriate economic development and provide opportunity for individuals to establish agriculture-based ventures in these areas. Economic development in the different barangays should reinforce traditional settlement patterns, protect the agricultural character of the municipality and revitalize village and growth centers. This plan therefore declares that the best interest of Burgos is to see to it that new development occurs in amanner that does not change the basic land use patterns, and consequently the character of Burgos. Therefore, the multiple points identified to function as growth centers below should be the focus for mixed-use, higher intensity development and new growth.&nbsp; Outlying areas should be designed and managed so as not to compromise the agricultural character of Burgos or its important natural resources.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>b. The Multi-Points of Growth</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The identified growth points are: (1) the Agri-Commercial points (i.e., the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac), (2) the Agri-InustriaLpoints (the barangays of PogoruacandPapallasen), (3) the Agri-Forest Mariculture points (i.e., the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen), (4) the Agri-Scenic points (i.e., the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena), and (5) the Agri-Tourism point (i.e., Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio). Calling these growth points by names prefixed by “agriculture” (i.e., Agri) emphasizes the role that agriculture is supposed to play in shaping the development of Burgos in combination with&nbsp; commerce and industry, fishing and aquaculture, tourism, and scenic management of the farmlands, forests and pasturelands.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The model advises that development interventions should be concentrated in these growth points while eventually seeing their effects on the other barangays. By deliberately planning changes in these growth points, harmonious changes in the three land-use-development-blocks are sought. Thus, the growth points are expected to generate further growth in surrounding barangays. The strategy aims to develop growth points as the foci for intervention.&nbsp; Apart from helping de-concentrate development away from the traditional centers, it is also designed to create new catchments for dispersing industry, commerce and people.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Commercial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate commercial activities by inducing entrepreneurs and investors to put up commercial shops and outlets in the Poblacion’s central business district and Pogoruac as the alternative commercial growth center in the opposite end of the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Industrial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate industrial activities primarily stemming from the invitation for industrial venture investments in two industrial hubs in the two said barangays.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Forest Mariculture Points</em></strong> are set in the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen. Both Ilio-ilo and Cacayasen are the sites forests areas Burgos. With the aim of expanding the protected forests in the municipality, these two barangays shall be the centers of forest management efforts.&nbsp; Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen are also the sites of substantial fishing activities. The coastal Ilio-ilio produces marine catch for local consumption while Cacayasen, with its fishponds is strategically the most favorable area for aquaculture since it is a low lying area where water is retained in natural and artificial ponds. This inherent geographical characteristic of the barangay which may render it non-conducive to farming and raising livestock warrants planning to developing it as a zone for aquaculture.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Scenic Points</em></strong> shall be the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena. Spatially, these three barangays form a belt which is transected by the road network. These three barangays, will serve as sections of the municipality’s transportation and utility corridor. Planning in these barangays should maximize productive land use without severing farm units while facilitating access for producers and harvesters. Guided by the goal of preserving the scenic stretches along the route, every effort should be made to avoid impairment of agricultural lands as well as the pasturelands. Proper planning in these barangays will ensure that the transportation and utility corridor will be managed carefully in the context of the agricultural lands and uses through which it passes. The transportation facilities should complement and serve, rather than harm the municipality’s farmlands, pastureland and agriculture industry through which they pass.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Tourism Point</em></strong> is the Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio. Cabongaoan shall serve as the end-point of a tourism destination which should include the whole of the municipality- branded as “scenic agricultural tourism.” This tourism concept is based on the design that the municipality can be presented as an agricultural community with distinct assets. Visitors can come in search of peaceful relaxation, inspiration, recreation, education and entertainment. Among the tourism assets of Burgos which can be the content of its marketing efforts should be its small town atmosphere, scenery, agricultural tourism, outdoor recreation, festivals and events, and&nbsp; environmental wonders culminating in its clean beach and coast&nbsp; in Cabongaoan.&nbsp; Thus, tourism in Burgos becomes not just an isolated activity in Cabongaoan but a municipality-wide promotion. Cabongaoan should be planned as the final destination at the end of the scenic corridor passing through the agricultural and scenic blocks of the municipality and as destination along the proposed coastal road of the province.&nbsp; To be effective, Cabongaoan should unify Burgos’ agricultural and rural community with beach tourism where functional and emotional benefits will be open to visitors. The whole of Burgos should therefore be considered as tourist destination and not only its beach.<strong><br></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'THE CONCEPT / STRUCTURE PLAN', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '109-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-09-13 13:23:47', '2020-09-13 13:23:47', '', 109, 'https://localhost/git/burgos-website/?p=143', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The central portion of the municipality is identified as a highly restricted agricultural area (HRAA). Thus Burgos is basically designated as an agricultural municipality making vital contributions to the agricultural and industrial development of the province. The PPFP does not mention any particular industries that can be the focus of development in the municipality. Forest lands for preservation are identified in the northernmost part while also mentioning the mangrove areas of Burgos. Reforestation, low susceptibility to landslides and flooding are noted. Among the concerns identified in the municipality are the need for socialized housing in view of its informal settlers, the need for a health service and water and sanitary facilities.&nbsp; The national road passing through Burgos is seen as an important factor that may affect development in the municipality. In like manner, the provincial road to Ilio-Ilio has been earmarked for conversion as national road. The proposed Dasol-Burgos-Agno-Bani-Bolinao coastal road has also been identified as a major intervention in the municipality. Mapped under the PPFP, Burgos is visualized basically for production land use with grazing, pasture and agricultural lands. In line with all these, the municipality of Burgos should be developed as an agricultural municipalityable to provide support for the other urban centers of the province given its strategic location.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.2.

Alternative 1: Agro-commercial development strategy (Natural Growth Pattern)</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Agricultural growth coupled with commercialization is already the trend in the municipality that coincides with what may be seen as the natural growth pattern that intends to followpast trends.&nbsp; The plan involves letting the urban area and other population centers develop following their natural tendency.&nbsp; Minimal local government intervention is required in implementing this type of development.The primary interventions shall be in protecting prime agricultural areas and providing agricultural support facilities and services. This shall be combined with efforts to increase access to markets through commercialization. Following the natural growth pattern, services and opportunities shall be concentrated in the barangays of the Poblacion and other areas such as the barangay of Pogoruac. Settlements and their support activities shall be developed along the existing major transportation and communication routes. (See Map No. 3, Natural Growth Pattern Map). Maintenance and upgrading of these primary routes shall be done to ensure mobility and to enhance accessibility.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The advantage of this form of development is the decongestion of the sole urban barangay of Burgos. It also means maximizing the use of the major road trunk line.&nbsp; In the long run however, this development plan tends to result in land use patterns that undermine the feasibility and opportunity of designing urban development in potential expansion areas.&nbsp; At the same time, it accelerates the conversion of prime agricultural areas from which the residents derive their daily sustenance. Thus the long-term effect negates the initial advantages gained.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>2.2. Alternative 2: Rapid Commercio-Industrialization Strategy (Classic Stellar or Constellation Pattern)</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Still connected with the first alternative, this second development thrusts includes industrialization as a partner of commercialization. This strategy would require the putting up of support services, facilities and utilities that shall support industrial activities.&nbsp; This strategy takes advantage of the agri-business and agri-industrial potentials of the municipality to complement the agricultural sector. Intensified commercialization shall take the form of providing trading centers (primarily for livestock) highlighting the envisioned roleof the municipality as a livestock provider for the whole province. Industrial and commercial facilities shall be used to attract investments into the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This kind of development sees a spatial strategy corresponding to the Classic Stellar or Constellation Model which is based on Hoyt’stheory that urban growth and development tends to follow major transportation and communications routes radiating away from the urban core. Such a development aided by government regulation and intervention assumes the shape of a starfish whose limbs symbolize the radiating arms of development. Applied to Burgos, the Poblacion is to be targeted as the center of &nbsp;development. Growth impetus is expected to spread outwards to the peripheral barangays along the major trunk lines. The concept, therefore, approximates a regulated form of the natural growth model but is also is be-saddled by that model’s negative collateral consequences.The main limitation of this model is that it makes no reference to out of town development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This model takes into account the observation that it is common for households to be near road lines, and commercial establishments to be along business thoroughfares. Recognizing that the various transportation routes into an urban area represented greater access, cities tended to grow in wedge-shaped patterns -- or sectors -- emanating from the central business district and centered on major transportation routes. Higher levels of access meant higher land values, thus, many commercial functions would remain in the central business district (the Poblacion) but manufacturing functions would develop in a wedge surrounding transportation routes. Residential functions would grow in wedge-shaped patterns.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Map No. 4, Classic Stellar Map, illustrates the Classic Stellar or Constellation model for Burgos.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3. THE STRUCTURE PLAN</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The definitive development thrust chosen for Burgos has been guided, to a large extent, by the municipality’s formulated vision and mission which, in turn, shaped the goals and strategies formulated from the different sectoral studies. Thus, the &nbsp;Goals Achievement Matrix (GAM) was the main tool used in analyzing the different alternatives development thrusts for the municipality. This structure plan presents the chosen development thrust.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3.1.Physical Development Concepts and Strategies Utilized</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3.1.1. Planning Concepts on Land</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>a. Land as Space</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Land as form and space is where life takes place and moves, making land a subject of various studies on geography, or the study of distribution of variables in land as space.&nbsp; As a space, land is deemed fixed in area.&nbsp; Only in exceptional cases does land increase in area such as reclamation.&nbsp; As a space, Land is occupied and utilized for various purposes usually in increasing requirements.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>b. Land as Location</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This concept considers the factor of land as a point in space wherein relative distance to other locations of different variables in spaces is studied.&nbsp; Location is a major factor affecting the value and uses of land.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>c. Land as Property</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This concept considers the ownership rights of individuals and/or groups.&nbsp; Within the context of the development proposals, the ownership right to use land as property is subjected to the regulations of the state for the purposes of general welfare and the optimum and efficient use of land as a resource.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3.1.2. Concepts and Principles in Land Use Planning</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>a. High/Best/Optimum Use</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Land is considered at its highest and optimum use when its use is for the purpose or combination of purposes, and in which it has the highest comparative advantage, or the least comparative disadvantage relative to other uses.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>b. Compatible Use</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A land use is considered compatible of said use if it could be in harmony with uses of land adjacent to the subject land use and/or to the dominant land use within the vicinity of subject land use.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>c. Land as limited fixed resource and as such must be managed for the welfare, and in accordance to the community’s operation as reflected in their development plan.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>d. The environment provides man with life supporting system and as such it shall be conserved and developed to enhance the quality of life.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>e. Land must be used in the most beneficial, rational and most efficient manner so as to prevent the mixture of incompatible uses, environmental hazards, slight depletion and degradation of land resources.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>f. There is a need for regulatory measures to promote the desired pattern of land use as proposed in this Comprehensive Land Use Plan.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>g. The concept of Hierarchy of Settlements</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Settlements naturally develop in varying degrees could be categorized into a hierarchical order of functions.&nbsp; Said natural development trends could, however be altered by planning efforts to effect the desired and efficient distribution of the hierarchical order of functions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>h. Growth Center Strategy</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This physical development strategy considers the situation with limited resources and the possible situation of such limited resources not efficiently distributed in land as space.&nbsp; Due to this situation, levels and types of growth centers are identified and located equitably as focal delivery points for specific types of services, facilities and resource opportunities to serve the designated influence area in an efficient manner.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>i. Concentric Development</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This physical development strategy takes into consideration the dispersal of activities within an urban core or center by expanding on the areas contiguous to, or adjacent to and beyond that core.&nbsp; The immediate and outer peripheries of the urban core are identified as the expansion area of urban growth and development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>j. Linear or Strip Development</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This physical development strategy follows trends that urban development form along major routes or trunk lines for transportation and communication.&nbsp; It is aimed to develop new hubs of economic activities along the major routes to disperse effects to its outlying areas.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>k. Central and Nodal Development</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This development concept follows a certain hierarchy of functions and sizes.&nbsp; The central point of activity is focused on the identified major growth center supported by growth nodes around it. It is assumed that the major growth center shall provide specialized facilities and services, which shall trickle out to the growth nodes.&nbsp; It also serves as the external link of the municipality to other municipalities and cities.&nbsp; The nodes, on the other hand, provide support to the major growth center as its captive market of both labor and resources, and at the same time disperse development services to its influence areas.&nbsp; An efficient circulation system is required to achieve complementarity of the major growth center and the nodes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3.2.&nbsp; Structure Plan</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The following structure plan is based on the preferred development strategy of Burgos described as<strong><em>agro-commercio-industrial &amp;agri-tourism management strategy</em></strong>. The structure plan, on the other hand is described as the <strong><em>Multi-Point Scenic Agricultural Development Model</em></strong>. The strategic plan makes a case for the preservation of the agricultural character of Burgos arguing that the municipality may be developed as a showcase agricultural community supported by agriculture-based commerce and industry, facilitated by its connectivity to other areas within the province via the road network, and guided by an aspiration to preserve its agricultural character.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This development plan lends a strong support for economic development that retains Burgos’ agricultural character and protects its important natural resources and pristine environment. Development in Burgos should maintain the quality of life of its people provided by a landscape dominated by farming, resource preservation, scenic areas and many opportunities for outdoor activities, while supporting the harvesting of agricultural products and other land based economic development. In keeping with this image, traditional economic growth should be encouraged in areas where infrastructure already exists or may be easily extended in order to minimize environmental degradation and haphazard transformation of the municipality’s character.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The said strategy is depicted in the following diagramand presented in the Structure/Concept Plan Map (See Map No. 5 and figure 3).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The diagram illustrates the preferred land use strategy of Burgos which tries to embody the harmony between agriculture-led development and the preservation of the agricultural town character of Burgos, hence the notion of&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>“<em>scenic agricultural development</em>.”</strong> While economic development via agriculture is the goal, the strategy aims to achieve this goal together with proper management of land uses that preserves the countryside character of the municipality. This is done, as shown in the diagram, through the interplay of three main “<strong><em>land use development blocks”</em></strong>or areasin the municipality, namely: (1) the commercial blocks, (2) agricultural blocks and (3) scenic blocks. Land uses in these areas are to be guided by the characteristics sought to be preserved in these blocks as described below. Zoning is thus understood in its ecological sense of designating areas with a distinct or characteristic system determined largely by its environment. Designated by translucent areas in the diagram (red for commercial blocks, green for agricultural blocks and light green scenic blocks), these blocks signify how artificial boundaries in the municipality’s land uses are transcended through the integration of space.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In order to orchestrate development in these blocks, the model calls for the designation of components of a system that may be designated as specific points of intervention or as the designated components of a multi-point approach resting on the identification of strategic barangays in the municipality. Instead of concentrating on one or two barangays as points of development, the model advocates systematically distributing development efforts in several barangays or “<strong><em>multi-points of growth</em></strong>.”&nbsp; Designated as growth points, these points are identified to provide the impetus for development in agriculture and agro-forestry, commerce and industry, and tourism. Encouraging economic activities in these multiple points will help reduce the likelihood of haphazard strip development along existing roads which may, above all, work to destroy the agricultural character of the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:table -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Figure 3&nbsp;&nbsp; : MULTI-POINT SCENIC AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT MODEL</strong><strong></strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong></strong> Scenic Blocks (Forest/Pasture) Agri-Commercial Point (Poblacion&amp; Adjacent barangays) Agri-ScenicPoints (Concordia-Sapa Grande- Sapa Pequena) &nbsp; Agricultural Blocks (Farmlands) Agri-Forest &amp;Mariculture Points (Ilio-ilio &amp; Cacayasen) Agri-TourismPoint (Cabongaoan Beach, Ilio-ilio) Commercial &amp; Industrial Blocks &nbsp; &nbsp; Potential Coastal Road Agri-Industrial Point (Pogoruac/Papallasen)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n<!-- /wp:table -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>a. The Land Use Development Blocks</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This strategy takes-off from the observation that Burgos has acquired an agricultural character through development that has kept large portions of the municipality in unsullied conditions. This plan focuses on amplifying and riding on this characteristic which can be presented as the specific difference Burgos. The rural agricultural character of Burgos exists due to the scenic vistas, large uninterrupted farmlands and pasturelands, forested areas, and limited and scattered development along the roads. This agricultural character should be of importance in planning for the municipality.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The agricultural character of Burgos may be evaluated from three perspectives represented by the three land-use-development-blocks- (1) the scenic blocks, (2) the agricultural block, and (3) the commercial blocks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Scenic Block</em>s</strong> are conceived from the vantage point of the road connecting the Poblacion to Ilio-ilio. The scenic blocks are to be characterized by views of fairly open areas adjacent to farmlands. More distant views of forested ridgelines shall also be highlighted. The several large farms along the road network shall add to the scenic agricultural character of the municipality. Scattered single family dwellings, some newer and some historic, located along the roadshall be kept. These views should be consciously protected in planning. The municipal protected areas should therefore include those areas within the forestry, pastureland and farmlands.&nbsp; Proper planning and zoning should allow the protection of these areas without limiting economic development through conservation easements. Basically, this should mean that the scenic views will be afforded some level of protection from indiscriminate development. It should be noted that many of the unprotected areas in Burgos are open fields and farms where future development would be highly visible. Development along the roads needs to preserve the open fields and farms and provide a visual and functional relationship of structures to the surrounding landscape. Development guidelines should be established to help protect the open fields along the scenic views from the road while still allowing controlled development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Commercial / Industrial Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the Poblacion and the national road network passing through the Poblacion which connotes a well-defined route along Burgos to the other municipalities in Western Pangasinan and the sites of agri-industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen. Thesecommercial areasareto be characterizedby mix of land uses with planned pockets of commercial areas, particularly in the Poblacion immediately adjacent barangays. The compact development of the Poblacion with its defined entry points and the fact that itserves as a center for local commercial and institutional activities defines its agricultural and commercial character. The sites of the industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be presented as areas for investments in industrial ventures. Development guidelines should allow and encourage the continuation of the village-style development in this area. Despite the commercialization to be allowed, economic development that promotes the viability of the working landscape should be designed along with forestry and agriculture-related enterprises that preserve the character of Burgos.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agricultural Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the productive agricultural lands in the Poblacion to San Vicente and San Miguel areas, as well as the agricultural areas in the western barangays of the municipality. The goal should be to stimulate appropriate economic development and provide opportunity for individuals to establish agriculture-based ventures in these areas. Economic development in the different barangays should reinforce traditional settlement patterns, protect the agricultural character of the municipality and revitalize village and growth centers. This plan therefore declares that the best interest of Burgos is to see to it that new development occurs in amanner that does not change the basic land use patterns, and consequently the character of Burgos. Therefore, the multiple points identified to function as growth centers below should be the focus for mixed-use, higher intensity development and new growth.&nbsp; Outlying areas should be designed and managed so as not to compromise the agricultural character of Burgos or its important natural resources.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>b. The Multi-Points of Growth</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The identified growth points are: (1) the Agri-Commercial points (i.e., the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac), (2) the Agri-InustriaLpoints (the barangays of PogoruacandPapallasen), (3) the Agri-Forest Mariculture points (i.e., the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen), (4) the Agri-Scenic points (i.e., the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena), and (5) the Agri-Tourism point (i.e., Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio). Calling these growth points by names prefixed by “agriculture” (i.e., Agri) emphasizes the role that agriculture is supposed to play in shaping the development of Burgos in combination with&nbsp; commerce and industry, fishing and aquaculture, tourism, and scenic management of the farmlands, forests and pasturelands.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The model advises that development interventions should be concentrated in these growth points while eventually seeing their effects on the other barangays. By deliberately planning changes in these growth points, harmonious changes in the three land-use-development-blocks are sought. Thus, the growth points are expected to generate further growth in surrounding barangays.

With the aim of expanding the protected forests in the municipality, these two barangays shall be the centers of forest management efforts.&nbsp; Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen are also the sites of substantial fishing activities. The coastal Ilio-ilio produces marine catch for local consumption while Cacayasen, with its fishponds is strategically the most favorable area for aquaculture since it is a low lying area where water is retained in natural and artificial ponds.

Planning in these barangays should maximize productive land use without severing farm units while facilitating access for producers and harvesters. Guided by the goal of preserving the scenic stretches along the route, every effort should be made to avoid impairment of agricultural lands as well as the pasturelands. Proper planning in these barangays will ensure that the transportation and utility corridor will be managed carefully in the context of the agricultural lands and uses through which it passes.

Visitors can come in search of peaceful relaxation, inspiration, recreation, education and entertainment. Among the tourism assets of Burgos which can be the content of its marketing efforts should be its small town atmosphere, scenery, agricultural tourism, outdoor recreation, festivals and events, and&nbsp; environmental wonders culminating in its clean beach and coast&nbsp; in Cabongaoan.&nbsp; Thus, tourism in Burgos becomes not just an isolated activity in Cabongaoan but a municipality-wide promotion. Cabongaoan should be planned as the final destination at the end of the scenic corridor passing through the agricultural and scenic blocks of the municipality and as destination along the proposed coastal road of the province.&nbsp; To be effective, Cabongaoan should unify Burgos’ agricultural and rural community with beach tourism where functional and emotional benefits will be open to visitors. The whole of Burgos should therefore be considered as tourist destination and not only its beach.<strong><br></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'THE CONCEPT / STRUCTURE PLAN', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '109-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-09-13 13:44:13', '2020-09-13 13:44:13', '', 109, 'https://localhost/git/burgos-website/?p=144', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.1.&nbsp; Functional Role of the Municipality</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The municipality of Burgos is recognized as an agricultural and agro-industrial municipality.&nbsp; The Provincial Physical Framework Plan (PPFP) of the Province of Pangasinan classifies Burgos as a satellite growth center, being connected to surrounding municipalities. The central portion of the municipality is identified as a highly restricted agricultural area (HRAA). Thus Burgos is basically designated as an agricultural municipality making vital contributions to the agricultural and industrial development of the province. The PPFP does not mention any particular industries that can be the focus of development in the municipality. Forest lands for preservation are identified in the northernmost part while also mentioning the mangrove areas of Burgos. Reforestation, low susceptibility to landslides and flooding are noted. Among the concerns identified in the municipality are the need for socialized housing in view of its informal settlers, the need for a health service and water and sanitary facilities.&nbsp; The national road passing through Burgos is seen as an important factor that may affect development in the municipality. In like manner, the provincial road to Ilio-Ilio has been earmarked for conversion as national road. The proposed Dasol-Burgos-Agno-Bani-Bolinao coastal road has also been identified as a major intervention in the municipality. Mapped under the PPFP, Burgos is visualized basically for production land use with grazing, pasture and agricultural lands. In line with all these, the municipality of Burgos should be developed as an agricultural municipalityable to provide support for the other urban centers of the province given its strategic location.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.2. Settlement Type</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Burgos is considered in the Provincial Physical Framework Plan as a 4<sup>th</sup> &nbsp;class municipality. The municipality shall remain as a small town, thus Burgos has adopted the same as its settlement goal until the end of the planning period.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.3. Population</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It has been projected that the municipality’s population will increase to 20,995 people by 2022. This population increase demands that the municipality provides more infrastructure facilities and services to address population demands.&nbsp; Apart from that, the provision of the needed land requirement to accommodate the population surplus as well as the observed informal settlements should be taken into account.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.4.

The upgrading of the existing commercial business district and the public market should be prioritized extending to stretches along the national highway. A satellite commercial district in the other end of the municipality should be developed.These commercial support facilities shall serve asalternative growth centers. The commercial focus of the municipality shall be further enhanced by marketing its central position to the other surrounding municipalities in the province.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>- Expansion of communication and transportation services</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The local government shall continue in efforts to establish moderntransportation and communication facilities and services tosupport economic revitalization.&nbsp; In order to speed up profitable economic transactions, the municipality shall provide for these facilities highlighting its connectivity with other municipalities. An area also targeted for expansion is the avenue of Internet access for all capable residents in order for them to be linked to the global information technology net. Transport activities along the major roads shall also be expanded.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>- Identification and advancement of tourism potentials</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Tourism shall be included in the thrusts of the municipality focused in its coastal areas.&nbsp; The tourism potentials of the municipality shall be roused by way of presenting the rural character of Burgos showcased along the major road network and connected to the coastal tourist attraction.&nbsp; Support facilities and activities shall be planned for and developed through specific tourism objectives on the coastal barangay radiating to adjacent barangays.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>- Promotion of Environmental Protection</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The maintenance of the natural resources of the municipality shall fostered by emphasizing scenic tourism and protection. Environmental protection programs shall be designed especially in the management of the limited forest resources of the municipality while keeping in mind the agricultural thrusts of the municipality. This shall be carried out through the laying down of appropriate plans.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>-&nbsp; Politico – Administrative machinery</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The development plans shall be spearheaded by vibrant politico-administrative machinery with appropriate and the entities tasked for implementation.&nbsp; Staffing pattern and reorganization pursuant to the Local Government Code, and the formulation of performance enhancement and evaluation systems to improve the delivery of basic services required by the growing population should be undertaken as early as the first year of the planning period.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>2.1. Alternative 1: Agro-commercial development strategy (Natural Growth Pattern)</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Agricultural growth coupled with commercialization is already the trend in the municipality that coincides with what may be seen as the natural growth pattern that intends to followpast trends.&nbsp; The plan involves letting the urban area and other population centers develop following their natural tendency.&nbsp; Minimal local government intervention is required in implementing this type of development.The primary interventions shall be in protecting prime agricultural areas and providing agricultural support facilities and services. This shall be combined with efforts to increase access to markets through commercialization. Following the natural growth pattern, services and opportunities shall be concentrated in the barangays of the Poblacion and other areas such as the barangay of Pogoruac. Settlements and their support activities shall be developed along the existing major transportation and communication routes. (See Map No. 3, Natural Growth Pattern Map). Maintenance and upgrading of these primary routes shall be done to ensure mobility and to enhance accessibility.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The advantage of this form of development is the decongestion of the sole urban barangay of Burgos. It also means maximizing the use of the major road trunk line.&nbsp; In the long run however, this development plan tends to result in land use patterns that undermine the feasibility and opportunity of designing urban development in potential expansion areas.&nbsp; At the same time, it accelerates the conversion of prime agricultural areas from which the residents derive their daily sustenance. Thus the long-term effect negates the initial advantages gained.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>2.2. Alternative 2: Rapid Commercio-Industrialization Strategy (Classic Stellar or Constellation Pattern)</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Still connected with the first alternative, this second development thrusts includes industrialization as a partner of commercialization. This strategy would require the putting up of support services, facilities and utilities that shall support industrial activities.&nbsp; This strategy takes advantage of the agri-business and agri-industrial potentials of the municipality to complement the agricultural sector. Intensified commercialization shall take the form of providing trading centers (primarily for livestock) highlighting the envisioned roleof the municipality as a livestock provider for the whole province. Industrial and commercial facilities shall be used to attract investments into the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This kind of development sees a spatial strategy corresponding to the Classic Stellar or Constellation Model which is based on Hoyt’stheory that urban growth and development tends to follow major transportation and communications routes radiating away from the urban core. Such a development aided by government regulation and intervention assumes the shape of a starfish whose limbs symbolize the radiating arms of development. Applied to Burgos, the Poblacion is to be targeted as the center of &nbsp;development. Growth impetus is expected to spread outwards to the peripheral barangays along the major trunk lines. The concept, therefore, approximates a regulated form of the natural growth model but is also is be-saddled by that model’s negative collateral consequences.The main limitation of this model is that it makes no reference to out of town development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This model takes into account the observation that it is common for households to be near road lines, and commercial establishments to be along business thoroughfares. Recognizing that the various transportation routes into an urban area represented greater access, cities tended to grow in wedge-shaped patterns -- or sectors -- emanating from the central business district and centered on major transportation routes. Higher levels of access meant higher land values, thus, many commercial functions would remain in the central business district (the Poblacion) but manufacturing functions would develop in a wedge surrounding transportation routes. Residential functions would grow in wedge-shaped patterns.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Map No. 4, Classic Stellar Map, illustrates the Classic Stellar or Constellation model for Burgos.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3. THE STRUCTURE PLAN</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The definitive development thrust chosen for Burgos has been guided, to a large extent, by the municipality’s formulated vision and mission which, in turn, shaped the goals and strategies formulated from the different sectoral studies. Thus, the &nbsp;Goals Achievement Matrix (GAM) was the main tool used in analyzing the different alternatives development thrusts for the municipality.

Planning Concepts on Land</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>a. Land as Space</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Land as form and space is where life takes place and moves, making land a subject of various studies on geography, or the study of distribution of variables in land as space.&nbsp; As a space, land is deemed fixed in area.&nbsp; Only in exceptional cases does land increase in area such as reclamation.&nbsp; As a space, Land is occupied and utilized for various purposes usually in increasing requirements.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>b. Land as Location</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This concept considers the factor of land as a point in space wherein relative distance to other locations of different variables in spaces is studied.&nbsp; Location is a major factor affecting the value and uses of land.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>c. Land as Property</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This concept considers the ownership rights of individuals and/or groups.&nbsp; Within the context of the development proposals, the ownership right to use land as property is subjected to the regulations of the state for the purposes of general welfare and the optimum and efficient use of land as a resource.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3.1.2. Concepts and Principles in Land Use Planning</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>a. High/Best/Optimum Use</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Land is considered at its highest and optimum use when its use is for the purpose or combination of purposes, and in which it has the highest comparative advantage, or the least comparative disadvantage relative to other uses.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>b. Compatible Use</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A land use is considered compatible of said use if it could be in harmony with uses of land adjacent to the subject land use and/or to the dominant land use within the vicinity of subject land use.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>c. Land as limited fixed resource and as such must be managed for the welfare, and in accordance to the community’s operation as reflected in their development plan.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>d. The environment provides man with life supporting system and as such it shall be conserved and developed to enhance the quality of life.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>e. Land must be used in the most beneficial, rational and most efficient manner so as to prevent the mixture of incompatible uses, environmental hazards, slight depletion and degradation of land resources.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>f. There is a need for regulatory measures to promote the desired pattern of land use as proposed in this Comprehensive Land Use Plan.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>g. The concept of Hierarchy of Settlements</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Settlements naturally develop in varying degrees could be categorized into a hierarchical order of functions.&nbsp; Said natural development trends could, however be altered by planning efforts to effect the desired and efficient distribution of the hierarchical order of functions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>h. Growth Center Strategy</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This physical development strategy considers the situation with limited resources and the possible situation of such limited resources not efficiently distributed in land as space.&nbsp; Due to this situation, levels and types of growth centers are identified and located equitably as focal delivery points for specific types of services, facilities and resource opportunities to serve the designated influence area in an efficient manner.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>i. Concentric Development</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This physical development strategy takes into consideration the dispersal of activities within an urban core or center by expanding on the areas contiguous to, or adjacent to and beyond that core.&nbsp; The immediate and outer peripheries of the urban core are identified as the expansion area of urban growth and development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>j.

The structure plan, on the other hand is described as the <strong><em>Multi-Point Scenic Agricultural Development Model</em></strong>. The strategic plan makes a case for the preservation of the agricultural character of Burgos arguing that the municipality may be developed as a showcase agricultural community supported by agriculture-based commerce and industry, facilitated by its connectivity to other areas within the province via the road network, and guided by an aspiration to preserve its agricultural character.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This development plan lends a strong support for economic development that retains Burgos’ agricultural character and protects its important natural resources and pristine environment. Development in Burgos should maintain the quality of life of its people provided by a landscape dominated by farming, resource preservation, scenic areas and many opportunities for outdoor activities, while supporting the harvesting of agricultural products and other land based economic development. In keeping with this image, traditional economic growth should be encouraged in areas where infrastructure already exists or may be easily extended in order to minimize environmental degradation and haphazard transformation of the municipality’s character.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The said strategy is depicted in the following diagramand presented in the Structure/Concept Plan Map (See Map No. 5 and figure 3).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The diagram illustrates the preferred land use strategy of Burgos which tries to embody the harmony between agriculture-led development and the preservation of the agricultural town character of Burgos, hence the notion of&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>“<em>scenic agricultural development</em>.”</strong> While economic development via agriculture is the goal, the strategy aims to achieve this goal together with proper management of land uses that preserves the countryside character of the municipality. This is done, as shown in the diagram, through the interplay of three main “<strong><em>land use development blocks”</em></strong>or areasin the municipality, namely: (1) the commercial blocks, (2) agricultural blocks and (3) scenic blocks. Land uses in these areas are to be guided by the characteristics sought to be preserved in these blocks as described below. Zoning is thus understood in its ecological sense of designating areas with a distinct or characteristic system determined largely by its environment. Designated by translucent areas in the diagram (red for commercial blocks, green for agricultural blocks and light green scenic blocks), these blocks signify how artificial boundaries in the municipality’s land uses are transcended through the integration of space.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In order to orchestrate development in these blocks, the model calls for the designation of components of a system that may be designated as specific points of intervention or as the designated components of a multi-point approach resting on the identification of strategic barangays in the municipality. Instead of concentrating on one or two barangays as points of development, the model advocates systematically distributing development efforts in several barangays or “<strong><em>multi-points of growth</em></strong>.”&nbsp; Designated as growth points, these points are identified to provide the impetus for development in agriculture and agro-forestry, commerce and industry, and tourism. Encouraging economic activities in these multiple points will help reduce the likelihood of haphazard strip development along existing roads which may, above all, work to destroy the agricultural character of the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:table -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Figure 3&nbsp;&nbsp; : MULTI-POINT SCENIC AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT MODEL</strong><strong></strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong></strong> Scenic Blocks (Forest/Pasture) Agri-Commercial Point (Poblacion&amp; Adjacent barangays) Agri-ScenicPoints (Concordia-Sapa Grande- Sapa Pequena) &nbsp; Agricultural Blocks (Farmlands) Agri-Forest &amp;Mariculture Points (Ilio-ilio &amp; Cacayasen) Agri-TourismPoint (Cabongaoan Beach, Ilio-ilio) Commercial &amp; Industrial Blocks &nbsp; &nbsp; Potential Coastal Road Agri-Industrial Point (Pogoruac/Papallasen)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n<!-- /wp:table -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>a. The Land Use Development Blocks</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This strategy takes-off from the observation that Burgos has acquired an agricultural character through development that has kept large portions of the municipality in unsullied conditions. This plan focuses on amplifying and riding on this characteristic which can be presented as the specific difference Burgos. The rural agricultural character of Burgos exists due to the scenic vistas, large uninterrupted farmlands and pasturelands, forested areas, and limited and scattered development along the roads. This agricultural character should be of importance in planning for the municipality.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The agricultural character of Burgos may be evaluated from three perspectives represented by the three land-use-development-blocks- (1) the scenic blocks, (2) the agricultural block, and (3) the commercial blocks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Scenic Block</em>s</strong> are conceived from the vantage point of the road connecting the Poblacion to Ilio-ilio. The scenic blocks are to be characterized by views of fairly open areas adjacent to farmlands. More distant views of forested ridgelines shall also be highlighted. The several large farms along the road network shall add to the scenic agricultural character of the municipality. Scattered single family dwellings, some newer and some historic, located along the roadshall be kept. These views should be consciously protected in planning. The municipal protected areas should therefore include those areas within the forestry, pastureland and farmlands.&nbsp; Proper planning and zoning should allow the protection of these areas without limiting economic development through conservation easements. Basically, this should mean that the scenic views will be afforded some level of protection from indiscriminate development. It should be noted that many of the unprotected areas in Burgos are open fields and farms where future development would be highly visible. Development along the roads needs to preserve the open fields and farms and provide a visual and functional relationship of structures to the surrounding landscape. Development guidelines should be established to help protect the open fields along the scenic views from the road while still allowing controlled development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Commercial / Industrial Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the Poblacion and the national road network passing through the Poblacion which connotes a well-defined route along Burgos to the other municipalities in Western Pangasinan and the sites of agri-industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen. Thesecommercial areasareto be characterizedby mix of land uses with planned pockets of commercial areas, particularly in the Poblacion immediately adjacent barangays. The compact development of the Poblacion with its defined entry points and the fact that itserves as a center for local commercial and institutional activities defines its agricultural and commercial character. The sites of the industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be presented as areas for investments in industrial ventures. Development guidelines should allow and encourage the continuation of the village-style development in this area. Despite the commercialization to be allowed, economic development that promotes the viability of the working landscape should be designed along with forestry and agriculture-related enterprises that preserve the character of Burgos.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agricultural Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the productive agricultural lands in the Poblacion to San Vicente and San Miguel areas, as well as the agricultural areas in the western barangays of the municipality. The goal should be to stimulate appropriate economic development and provide opportunity for individuals to establish agriculture-based ventures in these areas. Economic development in the different barangays should reinforce traditional settlement patterns, protect the agricultural character of the municipality and revitalize village and growth centers. This plan therefore declares that the best interest of Burgos is to see to it that new development occurs in amanner that does not change the basic land use patterns, and consequently the character of Burgos. Therefore, the multiple points identified to function as growth centers below should be the focus for mixed-use, higher intensity development and new growth.&nbsp; Outlying areas should be designed and managed so as not to compromise the agricultural character of Burgos or its important natural resources.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>b. The Multi-Points of Growth</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The identified growth points are: (1) the Agri-Commercial points (i.e., the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac), (2) the Agri-InustriaLpoints (the barangays of PogoruacandPapallasen), (3) the Agri-Forest Mariculture points (i.e., the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen), (4) the Agri-Scenic points (i.e., the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena), and (5) the Agri-Tourism point (i.e., Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio). Calling these growth points by names prefixed by “agriculture” (i.e., Agri) emphasizes the role that agriculture is supposed to play in shaping the development of Burgos in combination with&nbsp; commerce and industry, fishing and aquaculture, tourism, and scenic management of the farmlands, forests and pasturelands.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The model advises that development interventions should be concentrated in these growth points while eventually seeing their effects on the other barangays. By deliberately planning changes in these growth points, harmonious changes in the three land-use-development-blocks are sought. Thus, the growth points are expected to generate further growth in surrounding barangays. The strategy aims to develop growth points as the foci for intervention.&nbsp; Apart from helping de-concentrate development away from the traditional centers, it is also designed to create new catchments for dispersing industry, commerce and people.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Commercial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate commercial activities by inducing entrepreneurs and investors to put up commercial shops and outlets in the Poblacion’s central business district and Pogoruac as the alternative commercial growth center in the opposite end of the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Industrial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate industrial activities primarily stemming from the invitation for industrial venture investments in two industrial hubs in the two said barangays.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Forest Mariculture Points</em></strong> are set in the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen. Both Ilio-ilo and Cacayasen are the sites forests areas Burgos. With the aim of expanding the protected forests in the municipality, these two barangays shall be the centers of forest management efforts.&nbsp; Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen are also the sites of substantial fishing activities. The coastal Ilio-ilio produces marine catch for local consumption while Cacayasen, with its fishponds is strategically the most favorable area for aquaculture since it is a low lying area where water is retained in natural and artificial ponds. This inherent geographical characteristic of the barangay which may render it non-conducive to farming and raising livestock warrants planning to developing it as a zone for aquaculture.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Scenic Points</em></strong> shall be the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena. Spatially, these three barangays form a belt which is transected by the road network. These three barangays, will serve as sections of the municipality’s transportation and utility corridor. Planning in these barangays should maximize productive land use without severing farm units while facilitating access for producers and harvesters. Guided by the goal of preserving the scenic stretches along the route, every effort should be made to avoid impairment of agricultural lands as well as the pasturelands. Proper planning in these barangays will ensure that the transportation and utility corridor will be managed carefully in the context of the agricultural lands and uses through which it passes. The transportation facilities should complement and serve, rather than harm the municipality’s farmlands, pastureland and agriculture industry through which they pass.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Tourism Point</em></strong> is the Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio. Cabongaoan shall serve as the end-point of a tourism destination which should include the whole of the municipality- branded as “scenic agricultural tourism.” This tourism concept is based on the design that the municipality can be presented as an agricultural community with distinct assets. Visitors can come in search of peaceful relaxation, inspiration, recreation, education and entertainment. Among the tourism assets of Burgos which can be the content of its marketing efforts should be its small town atmosphere, scenery, agricultural tourism, outdoor recreation, festivals and events, and&nbsp; environmental wonders culminating in its clean beach and coast&nbsp; in Cabongaoan.&nbsp; Thus, tourism in Burgos becomes not just an isolated activity in Cabongaoan but a municipality-wide promotion. Cabongaoan should be planned as the final destination at the end of the scenic corridor passing through the agricultural and scenic blocks of the municipality and as destination along the proposed coastal road of the province.&nbsp; To be effective, Cabongaoan should unify Burgos’ agricultural and rural community with beach tourism where functional and emotional benefits will be open to visitors. The whole of Burgos should therefore be considered as tourist destination and not only its beach.<strong><br></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'THE CONCEPT / STRUCTURE PLAN', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '109-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-09-13 13:45:34', '2020-09-13 13:45:34', '', 109, 'https://localhost/git/burgos-website/?p=145', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.1.&nbsp; Functional Role of the Municipality</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The municipality of Burgos is recognized as an agricultural and agro-industrial municipality.&nbsp; The Provincial Physical Framework Plan (PPFP) of the Province of Pangasinan classifies Burgos as a satellite growth center, being connected to surrounding municipalities. The central portion of the municipality is identified as a highly restricted agricultural area (HRAA). Thus Burgos is basically designated as an agricultural municipality making vital contributions to the agricultural and industrial development of the province. The PPFP does not mention any particular industries that can be the focus of development in the municipality. Forest lands for preservation are identified in the northernmost part while also mentioning the mangrove areas of Burgos. Reforestation, low susceptibility to landslides and flooding are noted. Among the concerns identified in the municipality are the need for socialized housing in view of its informal settlers, the need for a health service and water and sanitary facilities.&nbsp; The national road passing through Burgos is seen as an important factor that may affect development in the municipality. In like manner, the provincial road to Ilio-Ilio has been earmarked for conversion as national road. The proposed Dasol-Burgos-Agno-Bani-Bolinao coastal road has also been identified as a major intervention in the municipality. Mapped under the PPFP, Burgos is visualized basically for production land use with grazing, pasture and agricultural lands. In line with all these, the municipality of Burgos should be developed as an agricultural municipalityable to provide support for the other urban centers of the province given its strategic location.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.2. Settlement Type</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Burgos is considered in the Provincial Physical Framework Plan as a 4<sup>th</sup> &nbsp;class municipality.

Population</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It has been projected that the municipality’s population will increase to 20,995 people by 2022. This population increase demands that the municipality provides more infrastructure facilities and services to address population demands.&nbsp; Apart from that, the provision of the needed land requirement to accommodate the population surplus as well as the observed informal settlements should be taken into account.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.4.

Alternative 1: Agro-commercial development strategy (Natural Growth Pattern)</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Agricultural growth coupled with commercialization is already the trend in the municipality that coincides with what may be seen as the natural growth pattern that intends to followpast trends.&nbsp; The plan involves letting the urban area and other population centers develop following their natural tendency.&nbsp; Minimal local government intervention is required in implementing this type of development.The primary interventions shall be in protecting prime agricultural areas and providing agricultural support facilities and services. This shall be combined with efforts to increase access to markets through commercialization. Following the natural growth pattern, services and opportunities shall be concentrated in the barangays of the Poblacion and other areas such as the barangay of Pogoruac. Settlements and their support activities shall be developed along the existing major transportation and communication routes. (See Map No. 3, Natural Growth Pattern Map). Maintenance and upgrading of these primary routes shall be done to ensure mobility and to enhance accessibility.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The advantage of this form of development is the decongestion of the sole urban barangay of Burgos. It also means maximizing the use of the major road trunk line.&nbsp; In the long run however, this development plan tends to result in land use patterns that undermine the feasibility and opportunity of designing urban development in potential expansion areas.&nbsp; At the same time, it accelerates the conversion of prime agricultural areas from which the residents derive their daily sustenance. Thus the long-term effect negates the initial advantages gained.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>2.2. Alternative 2: Rapid Commercio-Industrialization Strategy (Classic Stellar or Constellation Pattern)</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Still connected with the first alternative, this second development thrusts includes industrialization as a partner of commercialization. This strategy would require the putting up of support services, facilities and utilities that shall support industrial activities.&nbsp; This strategy takes advantage of the agri-business and agri-industrial potentials of the municipality to complement the agricultural sector. Intensified commercialization shall take the form of providing trading centers (primarily for livestock) highlighting the envisioned roleof the municipality as a livestock provider for the whole province. Industrial and commercial facilities shall be used to attract investments into the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This kind of development sees a spatial strategy corresponding to the Classic Stellar or Constellation Model which is based on Hoyt’stheory that urban growth and development tends to follow major transportation and communications routes radiating away from the urban core. Such a development aided by government regulation and intervention assumes the shape of a starfish whose limbs symbolize the radiating arms of development. Applied to Burgos, the Poblacion is to be targeted as the center of &nbsp;development. Growth impetus is expected to spread outwards to the peripheral barangays along the major trunk lines. The concept, therefore, approximates a regulated form of the natural growth model but is also is be-saddled by that model’s negative collateral consequences.The main limitation of this model is that it makes no reference to out of town development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This model takes into account the observation that it is common for households to be near road lines, and commercial establishments to be along business thoroughfares. Recognizing that the various transportation routes into an urban area represented greater access, cities tended to grow in wedge-shaped patterns -- or sectors -- emanating from the central business district and centered on major transportation routes. Higher levels of access meant higher land values, thus, many commercial functions would remain in the central business district (the Poblacion) but manufacturing functions would develop in a wedge surrounding transportation routes. Residential functions would grow in wedge-shaped patterns.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Map No. 4, Classic Stellar Map, illustrates the Classic Stellar or Constellation model for Burgos.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3. THE STRUCTURE PLAN</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The definitive development thrust chosen for Burgos has been guided, to a large extent, by the municipality’s formulated vision and mission which, in turn, shaped the goals and strategies formulated from the different sectoral studies.

Concepts and Principles in Land Use Planning</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>a. High/Best/Optimum Use</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Land is considered at its highest and optimum use when its use is for the purpose or combination of purposes, and in which it has the highest comparative advantage, or the least comparative disadvantage relative to other uses.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>b. Compatible Use</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A land use is considered compatible of said use if it could be in harmony with uses of land adjacent to the subject land use and/or to the dominant land use within the vicinity of subject land use.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>c. Land as limited fixed resource and as such must be managed for the welfare, and in accordance to the community’s operation as reflected in their development plan.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>d. The environment provides man with life supporting system and as such it shall be conserved and developed to enhance the quality of life.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>e. Land must be used in the most beneficial, rational and most efficient manner so as to prevent the mixture of incompatible uses, environmental hazards, slight depletion and degradation of land resources.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>f. There is a need for regulatory measures to promote the desired pattern of land use as proposed in this Comprehensive Land Use Plan.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>g. The concept of Hierarchy of Settlements</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Settlements naturally develop in varying degrees could be categorized into a hierarchical order of functions.&nbsp; Said natural development trends could, however be altered by planning efforts to effect the desired and efficient distribution of the hierarchical order of functions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>h. Growth Center Strategy</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This physical development strategy considers the situation with limited resources and the possible situation of such limited resources not efficiently distributed in land as space.&nbsp; Due to this situation, levels and types of growth centers are identified and located equitably as focal delivery points for specific types of services, facilities and resource opportunities to serve the designated influence area in an efficient manner.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>i. Concentric Development</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This physical development strategy takes into consideration the dispersal of activities within an urban core or center by expanding on the areas contiguous to, or adjacent to and beyond that core.&nbsp; The immediate and outer peripheries of the urban core are identified as the expansion area of urban growth and development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>j. Linear or Strip Development</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This physical development strategy follows trends that urban development form along major routes or trunk lines for transportation and communication.&nbsp; It is aimed to develop new hubs of economic activities along the major routes to disperse effects to its outlying areas.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>k. Central and Nodal Development</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This development concept follows a certain hierarchy of functions and sizes.&nbsp; The central point of activity is focused on the identified major growth center supported by growth nodes around it. It is assumed that the major growth center shall provide specialized facilities and services, which shall trickle out to the growth nodes.&nbsp; It also serves as the external link of the municipality to other municipalities and cities.&nbsp; The nodes, on the other hand, provide support to the major growth center as its captive market of both labor and resources, and at the same time disperse development services to its influence areas.&nbsp; An efficient circulation system is required to achieve complementarity of the major growth center and the nodes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3.2.&nbsp; Structure Plan</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The following structure plan is based on the preferred development strategy of Burgos described as<strong><em>agro-commercio-industrial &amp;agri-tourism management strategy</em></strong>. The structure plan, on the other hand is described as the <strong><em>Multi-Point Scenic Agricultural Development Model</em></strong>. The strategic plan makes a case for the preservation of the agricultural character of Burgos arguing that the municipality may be developed as a showcase agricultural community supported by agriculture-based commerce and industry, facilitated by its connectivity to other areas within the province via the road network, and guided by an aspiration to preserve its agricultural character.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This development plan lends a strong support for economic development that retains Burgos’ agricultural character and protects its important natural resources and pristine environment. Development in Burgos should maintain the quality of life of its people provided by a landscape dominated by farming, resource preservation, scenic areas and many opportunities for outdoor activities, while supporting the harvesting of agricultural products and other land based economic development. In keeping with this image, traditional economic growth should be encouraged in areas where infrastructure already exists or may be easily extended in order to minimize environmental degradation and haphazard transformation of the municipality’s character.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The said strategy is depicted in the following diagramand presented in the Structure/Concept Plan Map (See Map No. 5 and figure 3).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The diagram illustrates the preferred land use strategy of Burgos which tries to embody the harmony between agriculture-led development and the preservation of the agricultural town character of Burgos, hence the notion of&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>“<em>scenic agricultural development</em>.”</strong> While economic development via agriculture is the goal, the strategy aims to achieve this goal together with proper management of land uses that preserves the countryside character of the municipality. This is done, as shown in the diagram, through the interplay of three main “<strong><em>land use development blocks”</em></strong>or areasin the municipality, namely: (1) the commercial blocks, (2) agricultural blocks and (3) scenic blocks. Land uses in these areas are to be guided by the characteristics sought to be preserved in these blocks as described below. Zoning is thus understood in its ecological sense of designating areas with a distinct or characteristic system determined largely by its environment. Designated by translucent areas in the diagram (red for commercial blocks, green for agricultural blocks and light green scenic blocks), these blocks signify how artificial boundaries in the municipality’s land uses are transcended through the integration of space.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In order to orchestrate development in these blocks, the model calls for the designation of components of a system that may be designated as specific points of intervention or as the designated components of a multi-point approach resting on the identification of strategic barangays in the municipality. Instead of concentrating on one or two barangays as points of development, the model advocates systematically distributing development efforts in several barangays or “<strong><em>multi-points of growth</em></strong>.”&nbsp; Designated as growth points, these points are identified to provide the impetus for development in agriculture and agro-forestry, commerce and industry, and tourism. Encouraging economic activities in these multiple points will help reduce the likelihood of haphazard strip development along existing roads which may, above all, work to destroy the agricultural character of the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:table -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Figure 3&nbsp;&nbsp; : MULTI-POINT SCENIC AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT MODEL</strong><strong></strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong></strong> Scenic Blocks (Forest/Pasture) Agri-Commercial Point (Poblacion&amp; Adjacent barangays) Agri-ScenicPoints (Concordia-Sapa Grande- Sapa Pequena) &nbsp; Agricultural Blocks (Farmlands) Agri-Forest &amp;Mariculture Points (Ilio-ilio &amp; Cacayasen) Agri-TourismPoint (Cabongaoan Beach, Ilio-ilio) Commercial &amp; Industrial Blocks &nbsp; &nbsp; Potential Coastal Road Agri-Industrial Point (Pogoruac/Papallasen)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n<!-- /wp:table -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>a. The Land Use Development Blocks</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This strategy takes-off from the observation that Burgos has acquired an agricultural character through development that has kept large portions of the municipality in unsullied conditions. This plan focuses on amplifying and riding on this characteristic which can be presented as the specific difference Burgos. The rural agricultural character of Burgos exists due to the scenic vistas, large uninterrupted farmlands and pasturelands, forested areas, and limited and scattered development along the roads. This agricultural character should be of importance in planning for the municipality.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The agricultural character of Burgos may be evaluated from three perspectives represented by the three land-use-development-blocks- (1) the scenic blocks, (2) the agricultural block, and (3) the commercial blocks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Scenic Block</em>s</strong> are conceived from the vantage point of the road connecting the Poblacion to Ilio-ilio. The scenic blocks are to be characterized by views of fairly open areas adjacent to farmlands. More distant views of forested ridgelines shall also be highlighted. The several large farms along the road network shall add to the scenic agricultural character of the municipality. Scattered single family dwellings, some newer and some historic, located along the roadshall be kept. These views should be consciously protected in planning. The municipal protected areas should therefore include those areas within the forestry, pastureland and farmlands.&nbsp; Proper planning and zoning should allow the protection of these areas without limiting economic development through conservation easements. Basically, this should mean that the scenic views will be afforded some level of protection from indiscriminate development. It should be noted that many of the unprotected areas in Burgos are open fields and farms where future development would be highly visible. Development along the roads needs to preserve the open fields and farms and provide a visual and functional relationship of structures to the surrounding landscape. Development guidelines should be established to help protect the open fields along the scenic views from the road while still allowing controlled development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Commercial / Industrial Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the Poblacion and the national road network passing through the Poblacion which connotes a well-defined route along Burgos to the other municipalities in Western Pangasinan and the sites of agri-industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen. Thesecommercial areasareto be characterizedby mix of land uses with planned pockets of commercial areas, particularly in the Poblacion immediately adjacent barangays. The compact development of the Poblacion with its defined entry points and the fact that itserves as a center for local commercial and institutional activities defines its agricultural and commercial character. The sites of the industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be presented as areas for investments in industrial ventures. Development guidelines should allow and encourage the continuation of the village-style development in this area. Despite the commercialization to be allowed, economic development that promotes the viability of the working landscape should be designed along with forestry and agriculture-related enterprises that preserve the character of Burgos.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agricultural Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the productive agricultural lands in the Poblacion to San Vicente and San Miguel areas, as well as the agricultural areas in the western barangays of the municipality. The goal should be to stimulate appropriate economic development and provide opportunity for individuals to establish agriculture-based ventures in these areas. Economic development in the different barangays should reinforce traditional settlement patterns, protect the agricultural character of the municipality and revitalize village and growth centers. This plan therefore declares that the best interest of Burgos is to see to it that new development occurs in amanner that does not change the basic land use patterns, and consequently the character of Burgos. Therefore, the multiple points identified to function as growth centers below should be the focus for mixed-use, higher intensity development and new growth.&nbsp; Outlying areas should be designed and managed so as not to compromise the agricultural character of Burgos or its important natural resources.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>b. The Multi-Points of Growth</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The identified growth points are: (1) the Agri-Commercial points (i.e., the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac), (2) the Agri-InustriaLpoints (the barangays of PogoruacandPapallasen), (3) the Agri-Forest Mariculture points (i.e., the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen), (4) the Agri-Scenic points (i.e., the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena), and (5) the Agri-Tourism point (i.e., Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio). Calling these growth points by names prefixed by “agriculture” (i.e., Agri) emphasizes the role that agriculture is supposed to play in shaping the development of Burgos in combination with&nbsp; commerce and industry, fishing and aquaculture, tourism, and scenic management of the farmlands, forests and pasturelands.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The model advises that development interventions should be concentrated in these growth points while eventually seeing their effects on the other barangays. By deliberately planning changes in these growth points, harmonious changes in the three land-use-development-blocks are sought. Thus, the growth points are expected to generate further growth in surrounding barangays. The strategy aims to develop growth points as the foci for intervention.&nbsp; Apart from helping de-concentrate development away from the traditional centers, it is also designed to create new catchments for dispersing industry, commerce and people.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Commercial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate commercial activities by inducing entrepreneurs and investors to put up commercial shops and outlets in the Poblacion’s central business district and Pogoruac as the alternative commercial growth center in the opposite end of the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Industrial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate industrial activities primarily stemming from the invitation for industrial venture investments in two industrial hubs in the two said barangays.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Forest Mariculture Points</em></strong> are set in the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen. Both Ilio-ilo and Cacayasen are the sites forests areas Burgos. With the aim of expanding the protected forests in the municipality, these two barangays shall be the centers of forest management efforts.&nbsp; Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen are also the sites of substantial fishing activities. The coastal Ilio-ilio produces marine catch for local consumption while Cacayasen, with its fishponds is strategically the most favorable area for aquaculture since it is a low lying area where water is retained in natural and artificial ponds. This inherent geographical characteristic of the barangay which may render it non-conducive to farming and raising livestock warrants planning to developing it as a zone for aquaculture.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Scenic Points</em></strong> shall be the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena. Spatially, these three barangays form a belt which is transected by the road network. These three barangays, will serve as sections of the municipality’s transportation and utility corridor. Planning in these barangays should maximize productive land use without severing farm units while facilitating access for producers and harvesters. Guided by the goal of preserving the scenic stretches along the route, every effort should be made to avoid impairment of agricultural lands as well as the pasturelands. Proper planning in these barangays will ensure that the transportation and utility corridor will be managed carefully in the context of the agricultural lands and uses through which it passes. The transportation facilities should complement and serve, rather than harm the municipality’s farmlands, pastureland and agriculture industry through which they pass.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Tourism Point</em></strong> is the Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio. Cabongaoan shall serve as the end-point of a tourism destination which should include the whole of the municipality- branded as “scenic agricultural tourism.” This tourism concept is based on the design that the municipality can be presented as an agricultural community with distinct assets. Visitors can come in search of peaceful relaxation, inspiration, recreation, education and entertainment. Among the tourism assets of Burgos which can be the content of its marketing efforts should be its small town atmosphere, scenery, agricultural tourism, outdoor recreation, festivals and events, and&nbsp; environmental wonders culminating in its clean beach and coast&nbsp; in Cabongaoan.&nbsp; Thus, tourism in Burgos becomes not just an isolated activity in Cabongaoan but a municipality-wide promotion. Cabongaoan should be planned as the final destination at the end of the scenic corridor passing through the agricultural and scenic blocks of the municipality and as destination along the proposed coastal road of the province.&nbsp; To be effective, Cabongaoan should unify Burgos’ agricultural and rural community with beach tourism where functional and emotional benefits will be open to visitors. The whole of Burgos should therefore be considered as tourist destination and not only its beach.<strong><br></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'THE CONCEPT / STRUCTURE PLAN', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '109-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-09-13 13:54:12', '2020-09-13 13:54:12', '', 109, 'https://localhost/git/burgos-website/?p=146', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.1.&nbsp; Functional Role of the Municipality</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The municipality of Burgos is recognized as an agricultural and agro-industrial municipality.&nbsp; The Provincial Physical Framework Plan (PPFP) of the Province of Pangasinan classifies Burgos as a satellite growth center, being connected to surrounding municipalities. The central portion of the municipality is identified as a highly restricted agricultural area (HRAA). Thus Burgos is basically designated as an agricultural municipality making vital contributions to the agricultural and industrial development of the province. The PPFP does not mention any particular industries that can be the focus of development in the municipality. Forest lands for preservation are identified in the northernmost part while also mentioning the mangrove areas of Burgos. Reforestation, low susceptibility to landslides and flooding are noted. Among the concerns identified in the municipality are the need for socialized housing in view of its informal settlers, the need for a health service and water and sanitary facilities.&nbsp; The national road passing through Burgos is seen as an important factor that may affect development in the municipality. In like manner, the provincial road to Ilio-Ilio has been earmarked for conversion as national road. The proposed Dasol-Burgos-Agno-Bani-Bolinao coastal road has also been identified as a major intervention in the municipality. Mapped under the PPFP, Burgos is visualized basically for production land use with grazing, pasture and agricultural lands. In line with all these, the municipality of Burgos should be developed as an agricultural municipalityable to provide support for the other urban centers of the province given its strategic location.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.2. Settlement Type</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Burgos is considered in the Provincial Physical Framework Plan as a 4<sup>th</sup> &nbsp;class municipality.

Population</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It has been projected that the municipality’s population will increase to 20,995 people by 2022. This population increase demands that the municipality provides more infrastructure facilities and services to address population demands.&nbsp; Apart from that, the provision of the needed land requirement to accommodate the population surplus as well as the observed informal settlements should be taken into account.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.4.

The upgrading of the existing commercial business district and the public market should be prioritized extending to stretches along the national highway. A satellite commercial district in the other end of the municipality should be developed.These commercial support facilities shall serve asalternative growth centers. The commercial focus of the municipality shall be further enhanced by marketing its central position to the other surrounding municipalities in the province.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>- Expansion of communication and transportation services</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The local government shall continue in efforts to establish moderntransportation and communication facilities and services tosupport economic revitalization.&nbsp; In order to speed up profitable economic transactions, the municipality shall provide for these facilities highlighting its connectivity with other municipalities. An area also targeted for expansion is the avenue of Internet access for all capable residents in order for them to be linked to the global information technology net. Transport activities along the major roads shall also be expanded.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>- Identification and advancement of tourism potentials</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Tourism shall be included in the thrusts of the municipality focused in its coastal areas.&nbsp; The tourism potentials of the municipality shall be roused by way of presenting the rural character of Burgos showcased along the major road network and connected to the coastal tourist attraction.&nbsp; Support facilities and activities shall be planned for and developed through specific tourism objectives on the coastal barangay radiating to adjacent barangays.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>- Promotion of Environmental Protection</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The maintenance of the natural resources of the municipality shall fostered by emphasizing scenic tourism and protection. Environmental protection programs shall be designed especially in the management of the limited forest resources of the municipality while keeping in mind the agricultural thrusts of the municipality. This shall be carried out through the laying down of appropriate plans.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>-&nbsp; Politico – Administrative machinery</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The development plans shall be spearheaded by vibrant politico-administrative machinery with appropriate and the entities tasked for implementation.&nbsp; Staffing pattern and reorganization pursuant to the Local Government Code, and the formulation of performance enhancement and evaluation systems to improve the delivery of basic services required by the growing population should be undertaken as early as the first year of the planning period.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>2.1. Alternative 1: Agro-commercial development strategy (Natural Growth Pattern)</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Agricultural growth coupled with commercialization is already the trend in the municipality that coincides with what may be seen as the natural growth pattern that intends to followpast trends.&nbsp; The plan involves letting the urban area and other population centers develop following their natural tendency.&nbsp; Minimal local government intervention is required in implementing this type of development.The primary interventions shall be in protecting prime agricultural areas and providing agricultural support facilities and services. This shall be combined with efforts to increase access to markets through commercialization. Following the natural growth pattern, services and opportunities shall be concentrated in the barangays of the Poblacion and other areas such as the barangay of Pogoruac. Settlements and their support activities shall be developed along the existing major transportation and communication routes. (See Map No. 3, Natural Growth Pattern Map). Maintenance and upgrading of these primary routes shall be done to ensure mobility and to enhance accessibility.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The advantage of this form of development is the decongestion of the sole urban barangay of Burgos. It also means maximizing the use of the major road trunk line.&nbsp; In the long run however, this development plan tends to result in land use patterns that undermine the feasibility and opportunity of designing urban development in potential expansion areas.&nbsp; At the same time, it accelerates the conversion of prime agricultural areas from which the residents derive their daily sustenance. Thus the long-term effect negates the initial advantages gained.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>2.2. Alternative 2: Rapid Commercio-Industrialization Strategy (Classic Stellar or Constellation Pattern)</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Still connected with the first alternative, this second development thrusts includes industrialization as a partner of commercialization. This strategy would require the putting up of support services, facilities and utilities that shall support industrial activities.&nbsp; This strategy takes advantage of the agri-business and agri-industrial potentials of the municipality to complement the agricultural sector. Intensified commercialization shall take the form of providing trading centers (primarily for livestock) highlighting the envisioned roleof the municipality as a livestock provider for the whole province. Industrial and commercial facilities shall be used to attract investments into the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This kind of development sees a spatial strategy corresponding to the Classic Stellar or Constellation Model which is based on Hoyt’stheory that urban growth and development tends to follow major transportation and communications routes radiating away from the urban core. Such a development aided by government regulation and intervention assumes the shape of a starfish whose limbs symbolize the radiating arms of development. Applied to Burgos, the Poblacion is to be targeted as the center of &nbsp;development. Growth impetus is expected to spread outwards to the peripheral barangays along the major trunk lines. The concept, therefore, approximates a regulated form of the natural growth model but is also is be-saddled by that model’s negative collateral consequences.The main limitation of this model is that it makes no reference to out of town development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This model takes into account the observation that it is common for households to be near road lines, and commercial establishments to be along business thoroughfares. Recognizing that the various transportation routes into an urban area represented greater access, cities tended to grow in wedge-shaped patterns -- or sectors -- emanating from the central business district and centered on major transportation routes. Higher levels of access meant higher land values, thus, many commercial functions would remain in the central business district (the Poblacion) but manufacturing functions would develop in a wedge surrounding transportation routes. Residential functions would grow in wedge-shaped patterns.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Map No. 4, Classic Stellar Map, illustrates the Classic Stellar or Constellation model for Burgos.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3. THE STRUCTURE PLAN</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The definitive development thrust chosen for Burgos has been guided, to a large extent, by the municipality’s formulated vision and mission which, in turn, shaped the goals and strategies formulated from the different sectoral studies. Thus, the &nbsp;Goals Achievement Matrix (GAM) was the main tool used in analyzing the different alternatives development thrusts for the municipality.

Linear or Strip Development</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This physical development strategy follows trends that urban development form along major routes or trunk lines for transportation and communication.&nbsp; It is aimed to develop new hubs of economic activities along the major routes to disperse effects to its outlying areas.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>k. Central and Nodal Development</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This development concept follows a certain hierarchy of functions and sizes.&nbsp; The central point of activity is focused on the identified major growth center supported by growth nodes around it. It is assumed that the major growth center shall provide specialized facilities and services, which shall trickle out to the growth nodes.&nbsp; It also serves as the external link of the municipality to other municipalities and cities.&nbsp; The nodes, on the other hand, provide support to the major growth center as its captive market of both labor and resources, and at the same time disperse development services to its influence areas.&nbsp; An efficient circulation system is required to achieve complementarity of the major growth center and the nodes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3.2.&nbsp; Structure Plan</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The following structure plan is based on the preferred development strategy of Burgos described as<strong><em>agro-commercio-industrial &amp;agri-tourism management strategy</em></strong>. The structure plan, on the other hand is described as the <strong><em>Multi-Point Scenic Agricultural Development Model</em></strong>. The strategic plan makes a case for the preservation of the agricultural character of Burgos arguing that the municipality may be developed as a showcase agricultural community supported by agriculture-based commerce and industry, facilitated by its connectivity to other areas within the province via the road network, and guided by an aspiration to preserve its agricultural character.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This development plan lends a strong support for economic development that retains Burgos’ agricultural character and protects its important natural resources and pristine environment. Development in Burgos should maintain the quality of life of its people provided by a landscape dominated by farming, resource preservation, scenic areas and many opportunities for outdoor activities, while supporting the harvesting of agricultural products and other land based economic development. In keeping with this image, traditional economic growth should be encouraged in areas where infrastructure already exists or may be easily extended in order to minimize environmental degradation and haphazard transformation of the municipality’s character.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The said strategy is depicted in the following diagramand presented in the Structure/Concept Plan Map (See Map No. 5 and figure 3).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The diagram illustrates the preferred land use strategy of Burgos which tries to embody the harmony between agriculture-led development and the preservation of the agricultural town character of Burgos, hence the notion of&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>“<em>scenic agricultural development</em>.”</strong> While economic development via agriculture is the goal, the strategy aims to achieve this goal together with proper management of land uses that preserves the countryside character of the municipality. This is done, as shown in the diagram, through the interplay of three main “<strong><em>land use development blocks”</em></strong>or areasin the municipality, namely: (1) the commercial blocks, (2) agricultural blocks and (3) scenic blocks. Land uses in these areas are to be guided by the characteristics sought to be preserved in these blocks as described below. Zoning is thus understood in its ecological sense of designating areas with a distinct or characteristic system determined largely by its environment. Designated by translucent areas in the diagram (red for commercial blocks, green for agricultural blocks and light green scenic blocks), these blocks signify how artificial boundaries in the municipality’s land uses are transcended through the integration of space.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In order to orchestrate development in these blocks, the model calls for the designation of components of a system that may be designated as specific points of intervention or as the designated components of a multi-point approach resting on the identification of strategic barangays in the municipality. Instead of concentrating on one or two barangays as points of development, the model advocates systematically distributing development efforts in several barangays or “<strong><em>multi-points of growth</em></strong>.”&nbsp; Designated as growth points, these points are identified to provide the impetus for development in agriculture and agro-forestry, commerce and industry, and tourism. Encouraging economic activities in these multiple points will help reduce the likelihood of haphazard strip development along existing roads which may, above all, work to destroy the agricultural character of the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:table -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Figure 3&nbsp;&nbsp; : MULTI-POINT SCENIC AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT MODEL</strong><strong></strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong></strong> Scenic Blocks (Forest/Pasture) Agri-Commercial Point (Poblacion&amp; Adjacent barangays) Agri-ScenicPoints (Concordia-Sapa Grande- Sapa Pequena) &nbsp; Agricultural Blocks (Farmlands) Agri-Forest &amp;Mariculture Points (Ilio-ilio &amp; Cacayasen) Agri-TourismPoint (Cabongaoan Beach, Ilio-ilio) Commercial &amp; Industrial Blocks &nbsp; &nbsp; Potential Coastal Road Agri-Industrial Point (Pogoruac/Papallasen)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n<!-- /wp:table -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>a. The Land Use Development Blocks</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This strategy takes-off from the observation that Burgos has acquired an agricultural character through development that has kept large portions of the municipality in unsullied conditions. This plan focuses on amplifying and riding on this characteristic which can be presented as the specific difference Burgos. The rural agricultural character of Burgos exists due to the scenic vistas, large uninterrupted farmlands and pasturelands, forested areas, and limited and scattered development along the roads. This agricultural character should be of importance in planning for the municipality.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The agricultural character of Burgos may be evaluated from three perspectives represented by the three land-use-development-blocks- (1) the scenic blocks, (2) the agricultural block, and (3) the commercial blocks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Scenic Block</em>s</strong> are conceived from the vantage point of the road connecting the Poblacion to Ilio-ilio. The scenic blocks are to be characterized by views of fairly open areas adjacent to farmlands. More distant views of forested ridgelines shall also be highlighted. The several large farms along the road network shall add to the scenic agricultural character of the municipality. Scattered single family dwellings, some newer and some historic, located along the roadshall be kept. These views should be consciously protected in planning. The municipal protected areas should therefore include those areas within the forestry, pastureland and farmlands.&nbsp; Proper planning and zoning should allow the protection of these areas without limiting economic development through conservation easements. Basically, this should mean that the scenic views will be afforded some level of protection from indiscriminate development. It should be noted that many of the unprotected areas in Burgos are open fields and farms where future development would be highly visible. Development along the roads needs to preserve the open fields and farms and provide a visual and functional relationship of structures to the surrounding landscape. Development guidelines should be established to help protect the open fields along the scenic views from the road while still allowing controlled development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Commercial / Industrial Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the Poblacion and the national road network passing through the Poblacion which connotes a well-defined route along Burgos to the other municipalities in Western Pangasinan and the sites of agri-industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen. Thesecommercial areasareto be characterizedby mix of land uses with planned pockets of commercial areas, particularly in the Poblacion immediately adjacent barangays. The compact development of the Poblacion with its defined entry points and the fact that itserves as a center for local commercial and institutional activities defines its agricultural and commercial character. The sites of the industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be presented as areas for investments in industrial ventures. Development guidelines should allow and encourage the continuation of the village-style development in this area. Despite the commercialization to be allowed, economic development that promotes the viability of the working landscape should be designed along with forestry and agriculture-related enterprises that preserve the character of Burgos.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agricultural Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the productive agricultural lands in the Poblacion to San Vicente and San Miguel areas, as well as the agricultural areas in the western barangays of the municipality. The goal should be to stimulate appropriate economic development and provide opportunity for individuals to establish agriculture-based ventures in these areas. Economic development in the different barangays should reinforce traditional settlement patterns, protect the agricultural character of the municipality and revitalize village and growth centers. This plan therefore declares that the best interest of Burgos is to see to it that new development occurs in amanner that does not change the basic land use patterns, and consequently the character of Burgos. Therefore, the multiple points identified to function as growth centers below should be the focus for mixed-use, higher intensity development and new growth.&nbsp; Outlying areas should be designed and managed so as not to compromise the agricultural character of Burgos or its important natural resources.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>b. The Multi-Points of Growth</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The identified growth points are: (1) the Agri-Commercial points (i.e., the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac), (2) the Agri-InustriaLpoints (the barangays of PogoruacandPapallasen), (3) the Agri-Forest Mariculture points (i.e., the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen), (4) the Agri-Scenic points (i.e., the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena), and (5) the Agri-Tourism point (i.e., Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio). Calling these growth points by names prefixed by “agriculture” (i.e., Agri) emphasizes the role that agriculture is supposed to play in shaping the development of Burgos in combination with&nbsp; commerce and industry, fishing and aquaculture, tourism, and scenic management of the farmlands, forests and pasturelands.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The model advises that development interventions should be concentrated in these growth points while eventually seeing their effects on the other barangays. By deliberately planning changes in these growth points, harmonious changes in the three land-use-development-blocks are sought. Thus, the growth points are expected to generate further growth in surrounding barangays. The strategy aims to develop growth points as the foci for intervention.&nbsp; Apart from helping de-concentrate development away from the traditional centers, it is also designed to create new catchments for dispersing industry, commerce and people.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Commercial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate commercial activities by inducing entrepreneurs and investors to put up commercial shops and outlets in the Poblacion’s central business district and Pogoruac as the alternative commercial growth center in the opposite end of the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Industrial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate industrial activities primarily stemming from the invitation for industrial venture investments in two industrial hubs in the two said barangays.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Forest Mariculture Points</em></strong> are set in the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen. Both Ilio-ilo and Cacayasen are the sites forests areas Burgos. With the aim of expanding the protected forests in the municipality, these two barangays shall be the centers of forest management efforts.&nbsp; Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen are also the sites of substantial fishing activities. The coastal Ilio-ilio produces marine catch for local consumption while Cacayasen, with its fishponds is strategically the most favorable area for aquaculture since it is a low lying area where water is retained in natural and artificial ponds. This inherent geographical characteristic of the barangay which may render it non-conducive to farming and raising livestock warrants planning to developing it as a zone for aquaculture.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Scenic Points</em></strong> shall be the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena. Spatially, these three barangays form a belt which is transected by the road network. These three barangays, will serve as sections of the municipality’s transportation and utility corridor. Planning in these barangays should maximize productive land use without severing farm units while facilitating access for producers and harvesters. Guided by the goal of preserving the scenic stretches along the route, every effort should be made to avoid impairment of agricultural lands as well as the pasturelands. Proper planning in these barangays will ensure that the transportation and utility corridor will be managed carefully in the context of the agricultural lands and uses through which it passes. The transportation facilities should complement and serve, rather than harm the municipality’s farmlands, pastureland and agriculture industry through which they pass.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Tourism Point</em></strong> is the Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio. Cabongaoan shall serve as the end-point of a tourism destination which should include the whole of the municipality- branded as “scenic agricultural tourism.” This tourism concept is based on the design that the municipality can be presented as an agricultural community with distinct assets. Visitors can come in search of peaceful relaxation, inspiration, recreation, education and entertainment. Among the tourism assets of Burgos which can be the content of its marketing efforts should be its small town atmosphere, scenery, agricultural tourism, outdoor recreation, festivals and events, and&nbsp; environmental wonders culminating in its clean beach and coast&nbsp; in Cabongaoan.&nbsp; Thus, tourism in Burgos becomes not just an isolated activity in Cabongaoan but a municipality-wide promotion. Cabongaoan should be planned as the final destination at the end of the scenic corridor passing through the agricultural and scenic blocks of the municipality and as destination along the proposed coastal road of the province.&nbsp; To be effective, Cabongaoan should unify Burgos’ agricultural and rural community with beach tourism where functional and emotional benefits will be open to visitors. The whole of Burgos should therefore be considered as tourist destination and not only its beach.<strong><br></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'THE CONCEPT / STRUCTURE PLAN', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '109-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-09-13 14:01:29', '2020-09-13 14:01:29', '', 109, 'https://localhost/git/burgos-website/?p=152', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.1.&nbsp; Functional Role of the Municipality</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The municipality of Burgos is recognized as an agricultural and agro-industrial municipality.&nbsp; The Provincial Physical Framework Plan (PPFP) of the Province of Pangasinan classifies Burgos as a satellite growth center, being connected to surrounding municipalities. The central portion of the municipality is identified as a highly restricted agricultural area (HRAA). Thus Burgos is basically designated as an agricultural municipality making vital contributions to the agricultural and industrial development of the province. The PPFP does not mention any particular industries that can be the focus of development in the municipality. Forest lands for preservation are identified in the northernmost part while also mentioning the mangrove areas of Burgos. Reforestation, low susceptibility to landslides and flooding are noted. Among the concerns identified in the municipality are the need for socialized housing in view of its informal settlers, the need for a health service and water and sanitary facilities.&nbsp; The national road passing through Burgos is seen as an important factor that may affect development in the municipality. In like manner, the provincial road to Ilio-Ilio has been earmarked for conversion as national road. The proposed Dasol-Burgos-Agno-Bani-Bolinao coastal road has also been identified as a major intervention in the municipality. Mapped under the PPFP, Burgos is visualized basically for production land use with grazing, pasture and agricultural lands. In line with all these, the municipality of Burgos should be developed as an agricultural municipalityable to provide support for the other urban centers of the province given its strategic location.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.2. Settlement Type</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Burgos is considered in the Provincial Physical Framework Plan as a 4<sup>th</sup> &nbsp;class municipality. The municipality shall remain as a small town, thus Burgos has adopted the same as its settlement goal until the end of the planning period.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.3. Population</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It has been projected that the municipality’s population will increase to 20,995 people by 2022. This population increase demands that the municipality provides more infrastructure facilities and services to address population demands.&nbsp; Apart from that, the provision of the needed land requirement to accommodate the population surplus as well as the observed informal settlements should be taken into account.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.4.

Alternative 1: Agro-commercial development strategy (Natural Growth Pattern)</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Agricultural growth coupled with commercialization is already the trend in the municipality that coincides with what may be seen as the natural growth pattern that intends to followpast trends.&nbsp; The plan involves letting the urban area and other population centers develop following their natural tendency.&nbsp; Minimal local government intervention is required in implementing this type of development.The primary interventions shall be in protecting prime agricultural areas and providing agricultural support facilities and services. This shall be combined with efforts to increase access to markets through commercialization. Following the natural growth pattern, services and opportunities shall be concentrated in the barangays of the Poblacion and other areas such as the barangay of Pogoruac. Settlements and their support activities shall be developed along the existing major transportation and communication routes. (See Map No. 3, Natural Growth Pattern Map). Maintenance and upgrading of these primary routes shall be done to ensure mobility and to enhance accessibility.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The advantage of this form of development is the decongestion of the sole urban barangay of Burgos. It also means maximizing the use of the major road trunk line.&nbsp; In the long run however, this development plan tends to result in land use patterns that undermine the feasibility and opportunity of designing urban development in potential expansion areas.&nbsp; At the same time, it accelerates the conversion of prime agricultural areas from which the residents derive their daily sustenance. Thus the long-term effect negates the initial advantages gained.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>2.2. Alternative 2: Rapid Commercio-Industrialization Strategy (Classic Stellar or Constellation Pattern)</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Still connected with the first alternative, this second development thrusts includes industrialization as a partner of commercialization. This strategy would require the putting up of support services, facilities and utilities that shall support industrial activities.&nbsp; This strategy takes advantage of the agri-business and agri-industrial potentials of the municipality to complement the agricultural sector. Intensified commercialization shall take the form of providing trading centers (primarily for livestock) highlighting the envisioned roleof the municipality as a livestock provider for the whole province. Industrial and commercial facilities shall be used to attract investments into the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This kind of development sees a spatial strategy corresponding to the Classic Stellar or Constellation Model which is based on Hoyt’stheory that urban growth and development tends to follow major transportation and communications routes radiating away from the urban core. Such a development aided by government regulation and intervention assumes the shape of a starfish whose limbs symbolize the radiating arms of development. Applied to Burgos, the Poblacion is to be targeted as the center of &nbsp;development. Growth impetus is expected to spread outwards to the peripheral barangays along the major trunk lines. The concept, therefore, approximates a regulated form of the natural growth model but is also is be-saddled by that model’s negative collateral consequences.The main limitation of this model is that it makes no reference to out of town development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This model takes into account the observation that it is common for households to be near road lines, and commercial establishments to be along business thoroughfares. Recognizing that the various transportation routes into an urban area represented greater access, cities tended to grow in wedge-shaped patterns -- or sectors -- emanating from the central business district and centered on major transportation routes. Higher levels of access meant higher land values, thus, many commercial functions would remain in the central business district (the Poblacion) but manufacturing functions would develop in a wedge surrounding transportation routes. Residential functions would grow in wedge-shaped patterns.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Map No. 4, Classic Stellar Map, illustrates the Classic Stellar or Constellation model for Burgos.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3.

Central and Nodal Development</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This development concept follows a certain hierarchy of functions and sizes.&nbsp; The central point of activity is focused on the identified major growth center supported by growth nodes around it. It is assumed that the major growth center shall provide specialized facilities and services, which shall trickle out to the growth nodes.&nbsp; It also serves as the external link of the municipality to other municipalities and cities.&nbsp; The nodes, on the other hand, provide support to the major growth center as its captive market of both labor and resources, and at the same time disperse development services to its influence areas.&nbsp; An efficient circulation system is required to achieve complementarity of the major growth center and the nodes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3.2.&nbsp; Structure Plan</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The following structure plan is based on the preferred development strategy of Burgos described as<strong><em>agro-commercio-industrial &amp;agri-tourism management strategy</em></strong>. The structure plan, on the other hand is described as the <strong><em>Multi-Point Scenic Agricultural Development Model</em></strong>. The strategic plan makes a case for the preservation of the agricultural character of Burgos arguing that the municipality may be developed as a showcase agricultural community supported by agriculture-based commerce and industry, facilitated by its connectivity to other areas within the province via the road network, and guided by an aspiration to preserve its agricultural character.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This development plan lends a strong support for economic development that retains Burgos’ agricultural character and protects its important natural resources and pristine environment. Development in Burgos should maintain the quality of life of its people provided by a landscape dominated by farming, resource preservation, scenic areas and many opportunities for outdoor activities, while supporting the harvesting of agricultural products and other land based economic development. In keeping with this image, traditional economic growth should be encouraged in areas where infrastructure already exists or may be easily extended in order to minimize environmental degradation and haphazard transformation of the municipality’s character.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The said strategy is depicted in the following diagramand presented in the Structure/Concept Plan Map (See Map No. 5 and figure 3).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The diagram illustrates the preferred land use strategy of Burgos which tries to embody the harmony between agriculture-led development and the preservation of the agricultural town character of Burgos, hence the notion of&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>“<em>scenic agricultural development</em>.”</strong> While economic development via agriculture is the goal, the strategy aims to achieve this goal together with proper management of land uses that preserves the countryside character of the municipality. This is done, as shown in the diagram, through the interplay of three main “<strong><em>land use development blocks”</em></strong>or areasin the municipality, namely: (1) the commercial blocks, (2) agricultural blocks and (3) scenic blocks. Land uses in these areas are to be guided by the characteristics sought to be preserved in these blocks as described below. Zoning is thus understood in its ecological sense of designating areas with a distinct or characteristic system determined largely by its environment. Designated by translucent areas in the diagram (red for commercial blocks, green for agricultural blocks and light green scenic blocks), these blocks signify how artificial boundaries in the municipality’s land uses are transcended through the integration of space.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In order to orchestrate development in these blocks, the model calls for the designation of components of a system that may be designated as specific points of intervention or as the designated components of a multi-point approach resting on the identification of strategic barangays in the municipality. Instead of concentrating on one or two barangays as points of development, the model advocates systematically distributing development efforts in several barangays or “<strong><em>multi-points of growth</em></strong>.”&nbsp; Designated as growth points, these points are identified to provide the impetus for development in agriculture and agro-forestry, commerce and industry, and tourism. Encouraging economic activities in these multiple points will help reduce the likelihood of haphazard strip development along existing roads which may, above all, work to destroy the agricultural character of the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:table -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Figure 3&nbsp;&nbsp; : MULTI-POINT SCENIC AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT MODEL</strong><strong></strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong></strong> Scenic Blocks (Forest/Pasture) Agri-Commercial Point (Poblacion&amp; Adjacent barangays) Agri-ScenicPoints (Concordia-Sapa Grande- Sapa Pequena) &nbsp; Agricultural Blocks (Farmlands) Agri-Forest &amp;Mariculture Points (Ilio-ilio &amp; Cacayasen) Agri-TourismPoint (Cabongaoan Beach, Ilio-ilio) Commercial &amp; Industrial Blocks &nbsp; &nbsp; Potential Coastal Road Agri-Industrial Point (Pogoruac/Papallasen)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n<!-- /wp:table -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>a. The Land Use Development Blocks</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This strategy takes-off from the observation that Burgos has acquired an agricultural character through development that has kept large portions of the municipality in unsullied conditions. This plan focuses on amplifying and riding on this characteristic which can be presented as the specific difference Burgos. The rural agricultural character of Burgos exists due to the scenic vistas, large uninterrupted farmlands and pasturelands, forested areas, and limited and scattered development along the roads. This agricultural character should be of importance in planning for the municipality.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The agricultural character of Burgos may be evaluated from three perspectives represented by the three land-use-development-blocks- (1) the scenic blocks, (2) the agricultural block, and (3) the commercial blocks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Scenic Block</em>s</strong> are conceived from the vantage point of the road connecting the Poblacion to Ilio-ilio. The scenic blocks are to be characterized by views of fairly open areas adjacent to farmlands. More distant views of forested ridgelines shall also be highlighted. The several large farms along the road network shall add to the scenic agricultural character of the municipality. Scattered single family dwellings, some newer and some historic, located along the roadshall be kept. These views should be consciously protected in planning. The municipal protected areas should therefore include those areas within the forestry, pastureland and farmlands.&nbsp; Proper planning and zoning should allow the protection of these areas without limiting economic development through conservation easements. Basically, this should mean that the scenic views will be afforded some level of protection from indiscriminate development. It should be noted that many of the unprotected areas in Burgos are open fields and farms where future development would be highly visible. Development along the roads needs to preserve the open fields and farms and provide a visual and functional relationship of structures to the surrounding landscape. Development guidelines should be established to help protect the open fields along the scenic views from the road while still allowing controlled development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Commercial / Industrial Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the Poblacion and the national road network passing through the Poblacion which connotes a well-defined route along Burgos to the other municipalities in Western Pangasinan and the sites of agri-industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen. Thesecommercial areasareto be characterizedby mix of land uses with planned pockets of commercial areas, particularly in the Poblacion immediately adjacent barangays. The compact development of the Poblacion with its defined entry points and the fact that itserves as a center for local commercial and institutional activities defines its agricultural and commercial character. The sites of the industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be presented as areas for investments in industrial ventures. Development guidelines should allow and encourage the continuation of the village-style development in this area. Despite the commercialization to be allowed, economic development that promotes the viability of the working landscape should be designed along with forestry and agriculture-related enterprises that preserve the character of Burgos.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agricultural Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the productive agricultural lands in the Poblacion to San Vicente and San Miguel areas, as well as the agricultural areas in the western barangays of the municipality. The goal should be to stimulate appropriate economic development and provide opportunity for individuals to establish agriculture-based ventures in these areas. Economic development in the different barangays should reinforce traditional settlement patterns, protect the agricultural character of the municipality and revitalize village and growth centers. This plan therefore declares that the best interest of Burgos is to see to it that new development occurs in amanner that does not change the basic land use patterns, and consequently the character of Burgos. Therefore, the multiple points identified to function as growth centers below should be the focus for mixed-use, higher intensity development and new growth.&nbsp; Outlying areas should be designed and managed so as not to compromise the agricultural character of Burgos or its important natural resources.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>b. The Multi-Points of Growth</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The identified growth points are: (1) the Agri-Commercial points (i.e., the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac), (2) the Agri-InustriaLpoints (the barangays of PogoruacandPapallasen), (3) the Agri-Forest Mariculture points (i.e., the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen), (4) the Agri-Scenic points (i.e., the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena), and (5) the Agri-Tourism point (i.e., Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio). Calling these growth points by names prefixed by “agriculture” (i.e., Agri) emphasizes the role that agriculture is supposed to play in shaping the development of Burgos in combination with&nbsp; commerce and industry, fishing and aquaculture, tourism, and scenic management of the farmlands, forests and pasturelands.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The model advises that development interventions should be concentrated in these growth points while eventually seeing their effects on the other barangays. By deliberately planning changes in these growth points, harmonious changes in the three land-use-development-blocks are sought. Thus, the growth points are expected to generate further growth in surrounding barangays. The strategy aims to develop growth points as the foci for intervention.&nbsp; Apart from helping de-concentrate development away from the traditional centers, it is also designed to create new catchments for dispersing industry, commerce and people.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Commercial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate commercial activities by inducing entrepreneurs and investors to put up commercial shops and outlets in the Poblacion’s central business district and Pogoruac as the alternative commercial growth center in the opposite end of the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Industrial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate industrial activities primarily stemming from the invitation for industrial venture investments in two industrial hubs in the two said barangays.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Forest Mariculture Points</em></strong> are set in the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen. Both Ilio-ilo and Cacayasen are the sites forests areas Burgos. With the aim of expanding the protected forests in the municipality, these two barangays shall be the centers of forest management efforts.&nbsp; Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen are also the sites of substantial fishing activities. The coastal Ilio-ilio produces marine catch for local consumption while Cacayasen, with its fishponds is strategically the most favorable area for aquaculture since it is a low lying area where water is retained in natural and artificial ponds. This inherent geographical characteristic of the barangay which may render it non-conducive to farming and raising livestock warrants planning to developing it as a zone for aquaculture.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Scenic Points</em></strong> shall be the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena. Spatially, these three barangays form a belt which is transected by the road network. These three barangays, will serve as sections of the municipality’s transportation and utility corridor. Planning in these barangays should maximize productive land use without severing farm units while facilitating access for producers and harvesters. Guided by the goal of preserving the scenic stretches along the route, every effort should be made to avoid impairment of agricultural lands as well as the pasturelands. Proper planning in these barangays will ensure that the transportation and utility corridor will be managed carefully in the context of the agricultural lands and uses through which it passes. The transportation facilities should complement and serve, rather than harm the municipality’s farmlands, pastureland and agriculture industry through which they pass.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Tourism Point</em></strong> is the Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio. Cabongaoan shall serve as the end-point of a tourism destination which should include the whole of the municipality- branded as “scenic agricultural tourism.” This tourism concept is based on the design that the municipality can be presented as an agricultural community with distinct assets. Visitors can come in search of peaceful relaxation, inspiration, recreation, education and entertainment. Among the tourism assets of Burgos which can be the content of its marketing efforts should be its small town atmosphere, scenery, agricultural tourism, outdoor recreation, festivals and events, and&nbsp; environmental wonders culminating in its clean beach and coast&nbsp; in Cabongaoan.&nbsp; Thus, tourism in Burgos becomes not just an isolated activity in Cabongaoan but a municipality-wide promotion. Cabongaoan should be planned as the final destination at the end of the scenic corridor passing through the agricultural and scenic blocks of the municipality and as destination along the proposed coastal road of the province.&nbsp; To be effective, Cabongaoan should unify Burgos’ agricultural and rural community with beach tourism where functional and emotional benefits will be open to visitors. The whole of Burgos should therefore be considered as tourist destination and not only its beach.<strong><br></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'THE CONCEPT / STRUCTURE PLAN', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '109-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-09-13 14:04:27', '2020-09-13 14:04:27', '', 109, 'https://localhost/git/burgos-website/?p=153', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.1.&nbsp; Functional Role of the Municipality</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The municipality of Burgos is recognized as an agricultural and agro-industrial municipality.&nbsp; The Provincial Physical Framework Plan (PPFP) of the Province of Pangasinan classifies Burgos as a satellite growth center, being connected to surrounding municipalities. The central portion of the municipality is identified as a highly restricted agricultural area (HRAA). Thus Burgos is basically designated as an agricultural municipality making vital contributions to the agricultural and industrial development of the province. The PPFP does not mention any particular industries that can be the focus of development in the municipality. Forest lands for preservation are identified in the northernmost part while also mentioning the mangrove areas of Burgos. Reforestation, low susceptibility to landslides and flooding are noted. Among the concerns identified in the municipality are the need for socialized housing in view of its informal settlers, the need for a health service and water and sanitary facilities.&nbsp; The national road passing through Burgos is seen as an important factor that may affect development in the municipality. In like manner, the provincial road to Ilio-Ilio has been earmarked for conversion as national road. The proposed Dasol-Burgos-Agno-Bani-Bolinao coastal road has also been identified as a major intervention in the municipality. Mapped under the PPFP, Burgos is visualized basically for production land use with grazing, pasture and agricultural lands. In line with all these, the municipality of Burgos should be developed as an agricultural municipalityable to provide support for the other urban centers of the province given its strategic location.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.2. Settlement Type</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Burgos is considered in the Provincial Physical Framework Plan as a 4<sup>th</sup> &nbsp;class municipality. The municipality shall remain as a small town, thus Burgos has adopted the same as its settlement goal until the end of the planning period.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.3. Population</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It has been projected that the municipality’s population will increase to 20,995 people by 2022. This population increase demands that the municipality provides more infrastructure facilities and services to address population demands.&nbsp; Apart from that, the provision of the needed land requirement to accommodate the population surplus as well as the observed informal settlements should be taken into account.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.4. Existing and Future Resource Opportunities and Constraints</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1.4.1.

Alternative 1: Agro-commercial development strategy (Natural Growth Pattern)</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Agricultural growth coupled with commercialization is already the trend in the municipality that coincides with what may be seen as the natural growth pattern that intends to followpast trends.&nbsp; The plan involves letting the urban area and other population centers develop following their natural tendency.&nbsp; Minimal local government intervention is required in implementing this type of development.The primary interventions shall be in protecting prime agricultural areas and providing agricultural support facilities and services. This shall be combined with efforts to increase access to markets through commercialization. Following the natural growth pattern, services and opportunities shall be concentrated in the barangays of the Poblacion and other areas such as the barangay of Pogoruac. Settlements and their support activities shall be developed along the existing major transportation and communication routes. (See Map No. 3, Natural Growth Pattern Map). Maintenance and upgrading of these primary routes shall be done to ensure mobility and to enhance accessibility.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The advantage of this form of development is the decongestion of the sole urban barangay of Burgos. It also means maximizing the use of the major road trunk line.&nbsp; In the long run however, this development plan tends to result in land use patterns that undermine the feasibility and opportunity of designing urban development in potential expansion areas.&nbsp; At the same time, it accelerates the conversion of prime agricultural areas from which the residents derive their daily sustenance. Thus the long-term effect negates the initial advantages gained.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>2.2. Alternative 2: Rapid Commercio-Industrialization Strategy (Classic Stellar or Constellation Pattern)</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Still connected with the first alternative, this second development thrusts includes industrialization as a partner of commercialization. This strategy would require the putting up of support services, facilities and utilities that shall support industrial activities.&nbsp; This strategy takes advantage of the agri-business and agri-industrial potentials of the municipality to complement the agricultural sector. Intensified commercialization shall take the form of providing trading centers (primarily for livestock) highlighting the envisioned roleof the municipality as a livestock provider for the whole province. Industrial and commercial facilities shall be used to attract investments into the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This kind of development sees a spatial strategy corresponding to the Classic Stellar or Constellation Model which is based on Hoyt’stheory that urban growth and development tends to follow major transportation and communications routes radiating away from the urban core. Such a development aided by government regulation and intervention assumes the shape of a starfish whose limbs symbolize the radiating arms of development. Applied to Burgos, the Poblacion is to be targeted as the center of &nbsp;development. Growth impetus is expected to spread outwards to the peripheral barangays along the major trunk lines. The concept, therefore, approximates a regulated form of the natural growth model but is also is be-saddled by that model’s negative collateral consequences.The main limitation of this model is that it makes no reference to out of town development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This model takes into account the observation that it is common for households to be near road lines, and commercial establishments to be along business thoroughfares. Recognizing that the various transportation routes into an urban area represented greater access, cities tended to grow in wedge-shaped patterns -- or sectors -- emanating from the central business district and centered on major transportation routes. Higher levels of access meant higher land values, thus, many commercial functions would remain in the central business district (the Poblacion) but manufacturing functions would develop in a wedge surrounding transportation routes. Residential functions would grow in wedge-shaped patterns.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Map No. 4, Classic Stellar Map, illustrates the Classic Stellar or Constellation model for Burgos.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3.

The structure plan, on the other hand is described as the <strong><em>Multi-Point Scenic Agricultural Development Model</em></strong>. The strategic plan makes a case for the preservation of the agricultural character of Burgos arguing that the municipality may be developed as a showcase agricultural community supported by agriculture-based commerce and industry, facilitated by its connectivity to other areas within the province via the road network, and guided by an aspiration to preserve its agricultural character.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This development plan lends a strong support for economic development that retains Burgos’ agricultural character and protects its important natural resources and pristine environment. Development in Burgos should maintain the quality of life of its people provided by a landscape dominated by farming, resource preservation, scenic areas and many opportunities for outdoor activities, while supporting the harvesting of agricultural products and other land based economic development. In keeping with this image, traditional economic growth should be encouraged in areas where infrastructure already exists or may be easily extended in order to minimize environmental degradation and haphazard transformation of the municipality’s character.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The said strategy is depicted in the following diagramand presented in the Structure/Concept Plan Map (See Map No. 5 and figure 3).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The diagram illustrates the preferred land use strategy of Burgos which tries to embody the harmony between agriculture-led development and the preservation of the agricultural town character of Burgos, hence the notion of&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>“<em>scenic agricultural development</em>.”</strong> While economic development via agriculture is the goal, the strategy aims to achieve this goal together with proper management of land uses that preserves the countryside character of the municipality. This is done, as shown in the diagram, through the interplay of three main “<strong><em>land use development blocks”</em></strong>or areasin the municipality, namely: (1) the commercial blocks, (2) agricultural blocks and (3) scenic blocks. Land uses in these areas are to be guided by the characteristics sought to be preserved in these blocks as described below. Zoning is thus understood in its ecological sense of designating areas with a distinct or characteristic system determined largely by its environment.

Instead of concentrating on one or two barangays as points of development, the model advocates systematically distributing development efforts in several barangays or “<strong><em>multi-points of growth</em></strong>.”&nbsp; Designated as growth points, these points are identified to provide the impetus for development in agriculture and agro-forestry, commerce and industry, and tourism. Encouraging economic activities in these multiple points will help reduce the likelihood of haphazard strip development along existing roads which may, above all, work to destroy the agricultural character of the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:table -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Figure 3&nbsp;&nbsp; : MULTI-POINT SCENIC AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT MODEL</strong><strong></strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong></strong> Scenic Blocks (Forest/Pasture) Agri-Commercial Point (Poblacion&amp; Adjacent barangays) Agri-ScenicPoints (Concordia-Sapa Grande- Sapa Pequena) &nbsp; Agricultural Blocks (Farmlands) Agri-Forest &amp;Mariculture Points (Ilio-ilio &amp; Cacayasen) Agri-TourismPoint (Cabongaoan Beach, Ilio-ilio) Commercial &amp; Industrial Blocks &nbsp; &nbsp; Potential Coastal Road Agri-Industrial Point (Pogoruac/Papallasen)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n<!-- /wp:table -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>a. The Land Use Development Blocks</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This strategy takes-off from the observation that Burgos has acquired an agricultural character through development that has kept large portions of the municipality in unsullied conditions. This plan focuses on amplifying and riding on this characteristic which can be presented as the specific difference Burgos. The rural agricultural character of Burgos exists due to the scenic vistas, large uninterrupted farmlands and pasturelands, forested areas, and limited and scattered development along the roads. This agricultural character should be of importance in planning for the municipality.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The agricultural character of Burgos may be evaluated from three perspectives represented by the three land-use-development-blocks- (1) the scenic blocks, (2) the agricultural block, and (3) the commercial blocks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Scenic Block</em>s</strong> are conceived from the vantage point of the road connecting the Poblacion to Ilio-ilio. The scenic blocks are to be characterized by views of fairly open areas adjacent to farmlands. More distant views of forested ridgelines shall also be highlighted. The several large farms along the road network shall add to the scenic agricultural character of the municipality. Scattered single family dwellings, some newer and some historic, located along the roadshall be kept. These views should be consciously protected in planning. The municipal protected areas should therefore include those areas within the forestry, pastureland and farmlands.&nbsp; Proper planning and zoning should allow the protection of these areas without limiting economic development through conservation easements. Basically, this should mean that the scenic views will be afforded some level of protection from indiscriminate development. It should be noted that many of the unprotected areas in Burgos are open fields and farms where future development would be highly visible. Development along the roads needs to preserve the open fields and farms and provide a visual and functional relationship of structures to the surrounding landscape. Development guidelines should be established to help protect the open fields along the scenic views from the road while still allowing controlled development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Commercial / Industrial Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the Poblacion and the national road network passing through the Poblacion which connotes a well-defined route along Burgos to the other municipalities in Western Pangasinan and the sites of agri-industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen. Thesecommercial areasareto be characterizedby mix of land uses with planned pockets of commercial areas, particularly in the Poblacion immediately adjacent barangays. The compact development of the Poblacion with its defined entry points and the fact that itserves as a center for local commercial and institutional activities defines its agricultural and commercial character. The sites of the industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be presented as areas for investments in industrial ventures. Development guidelines should allow and encourage the continuation of the village-style development in this area. Despite the commercialization to be allowed, economic development that promotes the viability of the working landscape should be designed along with forestry and agriculture-related enterprises that preserve the character of Burgos.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agricultural Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the productive agricultural lands in the Poblacion to San Vicente and San Miguel areas, as well as the agricultural areas in the western barangays of the municipality. The goal should be to stimulate appropriate economic development and provide opportunity for individuals to establish agriculture-based ventures in these areas. Economic development in the different barangays should reinforce traditional settlement patterns, protect the agricultural character of the municipality and revitalize village and growth centers. This plan therefore declares that the best interest of Burgos is to see to it that new development occurs in amanner that does not change the basic land use patterns, and consequently the character of Burgos. Therefore, the multiple points identified to function as growth centers below should be the focus for mixed-use, higher intensity development and new growth.&nbsp; Outlying areas should be designed and managed so as not to compromise the agricultural character of Burgos or its important natural resources.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>b. The Multi-Points of Growth</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The identified growth points are: (1) the Agri-Commercial points (i.e., the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac), (2) the Agri-InustriaLpoints (the barangays of PogoruacandPapallasen), (3) the Agri-Forest Mariculture points (i.e., the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen), (4) the Agri-Scenic points (i.e., the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena), and (5) the Agri-Tourism point (i.e., Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio). Calling these growth points by names prefixed by “agriculture” (i.e., Agri) emphasizes the role that agriculture is supposed to play in shaping the development of Burgos in combination with&nbsp; commerce and industry, fishing and aquaculture, tourism, and scenic management of the farmlands, forests and pasturelands.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The model advises that development interventions should be concentrated in these growth points while eventually seeing their effects on the other barangays. By deliberately planning changes in these growth points, harmonious changes in the three land-use-development-blocks are sought. Thus, the growth points are expected to generate further growth in surrounding barangays. The strategy aims to develop growth points as the foci for intervention.&nbsp; Apart from helping de-concentrate development away from the traditional centers, it is also designed to create new catchments for dispersing industry, commerce and people.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Commercial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate commercial activities by inducing entrepreneurs and investors to put up commercial shops and outlets in the Poblacion’s central business district and Pogoruac as the alternative commercial growth center in the opposite end of the municipality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Industrial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate industrial activities primarily stemming from the invitation for industrial venture investments in two industrial hubs in the two said barangays.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Forest Mariculture Points</em></strong> are set in the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen.

With the aim of expanding the protected forests in the municipality, these two barangays shall be the centers of forest management efforts.&nbsp; Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen are also the sites of substantial fishing activities. The coastal Ilio-ilio produces marine catch for local consumption while Cacayasen, with its fishponds is strategically the most favorable area for aquaculture since it is a low lying area where water is retained in natural and artificial ponds. This inherent geographical characteristic of the barangay which may render it non-conducive to farming and raising livestock warrants planning to developing it as a zone for aquaculture.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Scenic Points</em></strong> shall be the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena. Spatially, these three barangays form a belt which is transected by the road network. These three barangays, will serve as sections of the municipality’s transportation and utility corridor. Planning in these barangays should maximize productive land use without severing farm units while facilitating access for producers and harvesters. Guided by the goal of preserving the scenic stretches along the route, every effort should be made to avoid impairment of agricultural lands as well as the pasturelands. Proper planning in these barangays will ensure that the transportation and utility corridor will be managed carefully in the context of the agricultural lands and uses through which it passes. The transportation facilities should complement and serve, rather than harm the municipality’s farmlands, pastureland and agriculture industry through which they pass.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Tourism Point</em></strong> is the Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio. Cabongaoan shall serve as the end-point of a tourism destination which should include the whole of the municipality- branded as “scenic agricultural tourism.” This tourism concept is based on the design that the municipality can be presented as an agricultural community with distinct assets. Visitors can come in search of peaceful relaxation, inspiration, recreation, education and entertainment. Among the tourism assets of Burgos which can be the content of its marketing efforts should be its small town atmosphere, scenery, agricultural tourism, outdoor recreation, festivals and events, and&nbsp; environmental wonders culminating in its clean beach and coast&nbsp; in Cabongaoan.&nbsp; Thus, tourism in Burgos becomes not just an isolated activity in Cabongaoan but a municipality-wide promotion. Cabongaoan should be planned as the final destination at the end of the scenic corridor passing through the agricultural and scenic blocks of the municipality and as destination along the proposed coastal road of the province.&nbsp; To be effective, Cabongaoan should unify Burgos’ agricultural and rural community with beach tourism where functional and emotional benefits will be open to visitors. The whole of Burgos should therefore be considered as tourist destination and not only its beach.<strong><br></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'THE CONCEPT / STRUCTURE PLAN', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '109-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-09-13 14:11:09', '2020-09-13 14:11:09', '', 109, 'https://localhost/git/burgos-website/?p=154', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The central portion of the municipality is identified as a highly restricted agricultural area (HRAA). Thus Burgos is basically designated as an agricultural municipality making vital contributions to the agricultural and industrial development of the province. The PPFP does not mention any particular industries that can be the focus of development in the municipality. Forest lands for preservation are identified in the northernmost part while also mentioning the mangrove areas of Burgos. Reforestation, low susceptibility to landslides and flooding are noted. Among the concerns identified in the municipality are the need for socialized housing in view of its informal settlers, the need for a health service and water and sanitary facilities.&nbsp; The national road passing through Burgos is seen as an important factor that may affect development in the municipality. In like manner, the provincial road to Ilio-Ilio has been earmarked for conversion as national road. The proposed Dasol-Burgos-Agno-Bani-Bolinao coastal road has also been identified as a major intervention in the municipality. Mapped under the PPFP, Burgos is visualized basically for production land use with grazing, pasture and agricultural lands. In line with all these, the municipality of Burgos should be developed as an agricultural municipalityable to provide support for the other urban centers of the province given its strategic location.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>1.2.

Population</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>It has been projected that the municipality’s population will increase to 20,995 people by 2022. This population increase demands that the municipality provides more infrastructure facilities and services to address population demands.&nbsp; Apart from that, the provision of the needed land requirement to accommodate the population surplus as well as the observed informal settlements should be taken into account.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>1.4.

The upgrading of the existing commercial business district and the public market should be prioritized extending to stretches along the national highway. A satellite commercial district in the other end of the municipality should be developed.These commercial support facilities shall serve asalternative growth centers. The commercial focus of the municipality shall be further enhanced by marketing its central position to the other surrounding municipalities in the province.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>- Expansion of communication and transportation services</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The local government shall continue in efforts to establish moderntransportation and communication facilities and services tosupport economic revitalization.&nbsp; In order to speed up profitable economic transactions, the municipality shall provide for these facilities highlighting its connectivity with other municipalities. An area also targeted for expansion is the avenue of Internet access for all capable residents in order for them to be linked to the global information technology net. Transport activities along the major roads shall also be expanded.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>- Identification and advancement of tourism potentials</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Tourism shall be included in the thrusts of the municipality focused in its coastal areas.&nbsp; The tourism potentials of the municipality shall be roused by way of presenting the rural character of Burgos showcased along the major road network and connected to the coastal tourist attraction.&nbsp; Support facilities and activities shall be planned for and developed through specific tourism objectives on the coastal barangay radiating to adjacent barangays.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>- Promotion of Environmental Protection</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The maintenance of the natural resources of the municipality shall fostered by emphasizing scenic tourism and protection.

Alternative 1: Agro-commercial development strategy (Natural Growth Pattern)</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Agricultural growth coupled with commercialization is already the trend in the municipality that coincides with what may be seen as the natural growth pattern that intends to followpast trends.&nbsp; The plan involves letting the urban area and other population centers develop following their natural tendency.&nbsp; Minimal local government intervention is required in implementing this type of development.The primary interventions shall be in protecting prime agricultural areas and providing agricultural support facilities and services. This shall be combined with efforts to increase access to markets through commercialization. Following the natural growth pattern, services and opportunities shall be concentrated in the barangays of the Poblacion and other areas such as the barangay of Pogoruac. Settlements and their support activities shall be developed along the existing major transportation and communication routes. (See Map No. 3, Natural Growth Pattern Map). Maintenance and upgrading of these primary routes shall be done to ensure mobility and to enhance accessibility.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The advantage of this form of development is the decongestion of the sole urban barangay of Burgos. It also means maximizing the use of the major road trunk line.&nbsp; In the long run however, this development plan tends to result in land use patterns that undermine the feasibility and opportunity of designing urban development in potential expansion areas.&nbsp; At the same time, it accelerates the conversion of prime agricultural areas from which the residents derive their daily sustenance. Thus the long-term effect negates the initial advantages gained.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>2.2. Alternative 2: Rapid Commercio-Industrialization Strategy (Classic Stellar or Constellation Pattern)</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Still connected with the first alternative, this second development thrusts includes industrialization as a partner of commercialization. This strategy would require the putting up of support services, facilities and utilities that shall support industrial activities.&nbsp; This strategy takes advantage of the agri-business and agri-industrial potentials of the municipality to complement the agricultural sector. Intensified commercialization shall take the form of providing trading centers (primarily for livestock) highlighting the envisioned roleof the municipality as a livestock provider for the whole province. Industrial and commercial facilities shall be used to attract investments into the municipality.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>This kind of development sees a spatial strategy corresponding to the Classic Stellar or Constellation Model which is based on Hoyt’stheory that urban growth and development tends to follow major transportation and communications routes radiating away from the urban core. Such a development aided by government regulation and intervention assumes the shape of a starfish whose limbs symbolize the radiating arms of development. Applied to Burgos, the Poblacion is to be targeted as the center of &nbsp;development. Growth impetus is expected to spread outwards to the peripheral barangays along the major trunk lines. The concept, therefore, approximates a regulated form of the natural growth model but is also is be-saddled by that model’s negative collateral consequences.The main limitation of this model is that it makes no reference to out of town development.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>This model takes into account the observation that it is common for households to be near road lines, and commercial establishments to be along business thoroughfares. Recognizing that the various transportation routes into an urban area represented greater access, cities tended to grow in wedge-shaped patterns -- or sectors -- emanating from the central business district and centered on major transportation routes. Higher levels of access meant higher land values, thus, many commercial functions would remain in the central business district (the Poblacion) but manufacturing functions would develop in a wedge surrounding transportation routes. Residential functions would grow in wedge-shaped patterns.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Map No. 4, Classic Stellar Map, illustrates the Classic Stellar or Constellation model for Burgos.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>3.

In keeping with this image, traditional economic growth should be encouraged in areas where infrastructure already exists or may be easily extended in order to minimize environmental degradation and haphazard transformation of the municipality’s character.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The said strategy is depicted in the following diagramand presented in the Structure/Concept Plan Map (See Map No. 5 and figure 3).</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The diagram illustrates the preferred land use strategy of Burgos which tries to embody the harmony between agriculture-led development and the preservation of the agricultural town character of Burgos, hence the notion of&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>“<em>scenic agricultural development</em>.”</strong> While economic development via agriculture is the goal, the strategy aims to achieve this goal together with proper management of land uses that preserves the countryside character of the municipality. This is done, as shown in the diagram, through the interplay of three main “<strong><em>land use development blocks”</em></strong>or areasin the municipality, namely: (1) the commercial blocks, (2) agricultural blocks and (3) scenic blocks. Land uses in these areas are to be guided by the characteristics sought to be preserved in these blocks as described below. Zoning is thus understood in its ecological sense of designating areas with a distinct or characteristic system determined largely by its environment. Designated by translucent areas in the diagram (red for commercial blocks, green for agricultural blocks and light green scenic blocks), these blocks signify how artificial boundaries in the municipality’s land uses are transcended through the integration of space.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>In order to orchestrate development in these blocks, the model calls for the designation of components of a system that may be designated as specific points of intervention or as the designated components of a multi-point approach resting on the identification of strategic barangays in the municipality. Instead of concentrating on one or two barangays as points of development, the model advocates systematically distributing development efforts in several barangays or “<strong><em>multi-points of growth</em></strong>.”&nbsp; Designated as growth points, these points are identified to provide the impetus for development in agriculture and agro-forestry, commerce and industry, and tourism. Encouraging economic activities in these multiple points will help reduce the likelihood of haphazard strip development along existing roads which may, above all, work to destroy the agricultural character of the municipality.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:table --></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\">\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Figure 3&nbsp;&nbsp; : MULTI-POINT SCENIC AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT MODEL</strong><strong></strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong></strong> Scenic Blocks (Forest/Pasture) Agri-Commercial Point (Poblacion&amp; Adjacent barangays) Agri-ScenicPoints (Concordia-Sapa Grande- Sapa Pequena) &nbsp; Agricultural Blocks (Farmlands) Agri-Forest &amp;Mariculture Points (Ilio-ilio &amp; Cacayasen) Agri-TourismPoint (Cabongaoan Beach, Ilio-ilio) Commercial &amp; Industrial Blocks &nbsp; &nbsp; Potential Coastal Road Agri-Industrial Point (Pogoruac/Papallasen)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</figure>\n<p><!-- /wp:table --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>a. The Land Use Development Blocks</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>This strategy takes-off from the observation that Burgos has acquired an agricultural character through development that has kept large portions of the municipality in unsullied conditions. This plan focuses on amplifying and riding on this characteristic which can be presented as the specific difference Burgos. The rural agricultural character of Burgos exists due to the scenic vistas, large uninterrupted farmlands and pasturelands, forested areas, and limited and scattered development along the roads. This agricultural character should be of importance in planning for the municipality.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The agricultural character of Burgos may be evaluated from three perspectives represented by the three land-use-development-blocks- (1) the scenic blocks, (2) the agricultural block, and (3) the commercial blocks.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Scenic Block</em>s</strong> are conceived from the vantage point of the road connecting the Poblacion to Ilio-ilio. The scenic blocks are to be characterized by views of fairly open areas adjacent to farmlands. More distant views of forested ridgelines shall also be highlighted. The several large farms along the road network shall add to the scenic agricultural character of the municipality. Scattered single family dwellings, some newer and some historic, located along the roadshall be kept. These views should be consciously protected in planning. The municipal protected areas should therefore include those areas within the forestry, pastureland and farmlands.&nbsp; Proper planning and zoning should allow the protection of these areas without limiting economic development through conservation easements. Basically, this should mean that the scenic views will be afforded some level of protection from indiscriminate development. It should be noted that many of the unprotected areas in Burgos are open fields and farms where future development would be highly visible. Development along the roads needs to preserve the open fields and farms and provide a visual and functional relationship of structures to the surrounding landscape. Development guidelines should be established to help protect the open fields along the scenic views from the road while still allowing controlled development.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Commercial / Industrial Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the Poblacion and the national road network passing through the Poblacion which connotes a well-defined route along Burgos to the other municipalities in Western Pangasinan and the sites of agri-industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen. Thesecommercial areasareto be characterizedby mix of land uses with planned pockets of commercial areas, particularly in the Poblacion immediately adjacent barangays. The compact development of the Poblacion with its defined entry points and the fact that itserves as a center for local commercial and institutional activities defines its agricultural and commercial character. The sites of the industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be presented as areas for investments in industrial ventures. Development guidelines should allow and encourage the continuation of the village-style development in this area. Despite the commercialization to be allowed, economic development that promotes the viability of the working landscape should be designed along with forestry and agriculture-related enterprises that preserve the character of Burgos.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agricultural Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the productive agricultural lands in the Poblacion to San Vicente and San Miguel areas, as well as the agricultural areas in the western barangays of the municipality. The goal should be to stimulate appropriate economic development and provide opportunity for individuals to establish agriculture-based ventures in these areas. Economic development in the different barangays should reinforce traditional settlement patterns, protect the agricultural character of the municipality and revitalize village and growth centers. This plan therefore declares that the best interest of Burgos is to see to it that new development occurs in amanner that does not change the basic land use patterns, and consequently the character of Burgos. Therefore, the multiple points identified to function as growth centers below should be the focus for mixed-use, higher intensity development and new growth.&nbsp; Outlying areas should be designed and managed so as not to compromise the agricultural character of Burgos or its important natural resources.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>b. The Multi-Points of Growth</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The identified growth points are: (1) the Agri-Commercial points (i.e., the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac), (2) the Agri-InustriaLpoints (the barangays of PogoruacandPapallasen), (3) the Agri-Forest Mariculture points (i.e., the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen), (4) the Agri-Scenic points (i.e., the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena), and (5) the Agri-Tourism point (i.e., Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio). Calling these growth points by names prefixed by “agriculture” (i.e., Agri) emphasizes the role that agriculture is supposed to play in shaping the development of Burgos in combination with&nbsp; commerce and industry, fishing and aquaculture, tourism, and scenic management of the farmlands, forests and pasturelands.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The model advises that development interventions should be concentrated in these growth points while eventually seeing their effects on the other barangays. By deliberately planning changes in these growth points, harmonious changes in the three land-use-development-blocks are sought. Thus, the growth points are expected to generate further growth in surrounding barangays. The strategy aims to develop growth points as the foci for intervention.&nbsp; Apart from helping de-concentrate development away from the traditional centers, it is also designed to create new catchments for dispersing industry, commerce and people.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Commercial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate commercial activities by inducing entrepreneurs and investors to put up commercial shops and outlets in the Poblacion’s central business district and Pogoruac as the alternative commercial growth center in the opposite end of the municipality.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Industrial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate industrial activities primarily stemming from the invitation for industrial venture investments in two industrial hubs in the two said barangays.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Forest Mariculture Points</em></strong> are set in the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen. Both Ilio-ilo and Cacayasen are the sites forests areas Burgos. With the aim of expanding the protected forests in the municipality, these two barangays shall be the centers of forest management efforts.&nbsp; Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen are also the sites of substantial fishing activities. The coastal Ilio-ilio produces marine catch for local consumption while Cacayasen, with its fishponds is strategically the most favorable area for aquaculture since it is a low lying area where water is retained in natural and artificial ponds. This inherent geographical characteristic of the barangay which may render it non-conducive to farming and raising livestock warrants planning to developing it as a zone for aquaculture.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Scenic Points</em></strong> shall be the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena. Spatially, these three barangays form a belt which is transected by the road network. These three barangays, will serve as sections of the municipality’s transportation and utility corridor. Planning in these barangays should maximize productive land use without severing farm units while facilitating access for producers and harvesters. Guided by the goal of preserving the scenic stretches along the route, every effort should be made to avoid impairment of agricultural lands as well as the pasturelands. Proper planning in these barangays will ensure that the transportation and utility corridor will be managed carefully in the context of the agricultural lands and uses through which it passes. The transportation facilities should complement and serve, rather than harm the municipality’s farmlands, pastureland and agriculture industry through which they pass.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Tourism Point</em></strong> is the Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio. Cabongaoan shall serve as the end-point of a tourism destination which should include the whole of the municipality- branded as “scenic agricultural tourism.” This tourism concept is based on the design that the municipality can be presented as an agricultural community with distinct assets. Visitors can come in search of peaceful relaxation, inspiration, recreation, education and entertainment. Among the tourism assets of Burgos which can be the content of its marketing efforts should be its small town atmosphere, scenery, agricultural tourism, outdoor recreation, festivals and events, and&nbsp; environmental wonders culminating in its clean beach and coast&nbsp; in Cabongaoan.&nbsp; Thus, tourism in Burgos becomes not just an isolated activity in Cabongaoan but a municipality-wide promotion. Cabongaoan should be planned as the final destination at the end of the scenic corridor passing through the agricultural and scenic blocks of the municipality and as destination along the proposed coastal road of the province.&nbsp; To be effective, Cabongaoan should unify Burgos’ agricultural and rural community with beach tourism where functional and emotional benefits will be open to visitors. The whole of Burgos should therefore be considered as tourist destination and not only its beach.<strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p></li></ul>', 'THE CONCEPT / STRUCTURE PLAN', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '109-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-09-14 10:47:46', '2020-09-14 10:47:46', '', 109, 'https://localhost/git/burgos-website/?p=216', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><!-- wp:list--></p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:none;\">\n<li><strong>1.1.&nbsp; Functional Role of the Municipality</strong>\n<p>The municipality of Burgos is recognized as an agricultural and agro-industrial municipality.&nbsp; The Provincial Physical Framework Plan (PPFP) of the Province of Pangasinan classifies Burgos as a satellite growth center, being connected to surrounding municipalities. The central portion of the municipality is identified as a highly restricted agricultural area (HRAA). Thus Burgos is basically designated as an agricultural municipality making vital contributions to the agricultural and industrial development of the province. The PPFP does not mention any particular industries that can be the focus of development in the municipality. Forest lands for preservation are identified in the northernmost part while also mentioning the mangrove areas of Burgos. Reforestation, low susceptibility to landslides and flooding are noted. Among the concerns identified in the municipality are the need for socialized housing in view of its informal settlers, the need for a health service and water and sanitary facilities.&nbsp; The national road passing through Burgos is seen as an important factor that may affect development in the municipality. In like manner, the provincial road to Ilio-Ilio has been earmarked for conversion as national road. The proposed Dasol-Burgos-Agno-Bani-Bolinao coastal road has also been identified as a major intervention in the municipality. Mapped under the PPFP, Burgos is visualized basically for production land use with grazing, pasture and agricultural lands. In line with all these, the municipality of Burgos should be developed as an agricultural municipalityable to provide support for the other urban centers of the province given its strategic location.</p>\n</li>\n<p>&lt;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>1.2.

Population</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>It has been projected that the municipality’s population will increase to 20,995 people by 2022. This population increase demands that the municipality provides more infrastructure facilities and services to address population demands.&nbsp; Apart from that, the provision of the needed land requirement to accommodate the population surplus as well as the observed informal settlements should be taken into account.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>1.4. Existing and Future Resource Opportunities and Constraints</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>1.4.1.

Nevertheless, critical areas within the municipality also pose barriers in extensive development.&nbsp; Occurrence of erosion can be detrimental to agricultural crops including urban area expansion and development.&nbsp; It also poses danger to life, limb and property of residents.

Alternative 1: Agro-commercial development strategy (Natural Growth Pattern)</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Agricultural growth coupled with commercialization is already the trend in the municipality that coincides with what may be seen as the natural growth pattern that intends to followpast trends.&nbsp; The plan involves letting the urban area and other population centers develop following their natural tendency.&nbsp; Minimal local government intervention is required in implementing this type of development.The primary interventions shall be in protecting prime agricultural areas and providing agricultural support facilities and services. This shall be combined with efforts to increase access to markets through commercialization. Following the natural growth pattern, services and opportunities shall be concentrated in the barangays of the Poblacion and other areas such as the barangay of Pogoruac. Settlements and their support activities shall be developed along the existing major transportation and communication routes. (See Map No. 3, Natural Growth Pattern Map). Maintenance and upgrading of these primary routes shall be done to ensure mobility and to enhance accessibility.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The advantage of this form of development is the decongestion of the sole urban barangay of Burgos. It also means maximizing the use of the major road trunk line.&nbsp; In the long run however, this development plan tends to result in land use patterns that undermine the feasibility and opportunity of designing urban development in potential expansion areas.&nbsp; At the same time, it accelerates the conversion of prime agricultural areas from which the residents derive their daily sustenance. Thus the long-term effect negates the initial advantages gained.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>2.2. Alternative 2: Rapid Commercio-Industrialization Strategy (Classic Stellar or Constellation Pattern)</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Still connected with the first alternative, this second development thrusts includes industrialization as a partner of commercialization. This strategy would require the putting up of support services, facilities and utilities that shall support industrial activities.&nbsp; This strategy takes advantage of the agri-business and agri-industrial potentials of the municipality to complement the agricultural sector. Intensified commercialization shall take the form of providing trading centers (primarily for livestock) highlighting the envisioned roleof the municipality as a livestock provider for the whole province. Industrial and commercial facilities shall be used to attract investments into the municipality.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>This kind of development sees a spatial strategy corresponding to the Classic Stellar or Constellation Model which is based on Hoyt’stheory that urban growth and development tends to follow major transportation and communications routes radiating away from the urban core. Such a development aided by government regulation and intervention assumes the shape of a starfish whose limbs symbolize the radiating arms of development. Applied to Burgos, the Poblacion is to be targeted as the center of &nbsp;development. Growth impetus is expected to spread outwards to the peripheral barangays along the major trunk lines. The concept, therefore, approximates a regulated form of the natural growth model but is also is be-saddled by that model’s negative collateral consequences.The main limitation of this model is that it makes no reference to out of town development.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>This model takes into account the observation that it is common for households to be near road lines, and commercial establishments to be along business thoroughfares. Recognizing that the various transportation routes into an urban area represented greater access, cities tended to grow in wedge-shaped patterns -- or sectors -- emanating from the central business district and centered on major transportation routes. Higher levels of access meant higher land values, thus, many commercial functions would remain in the central business district (the Poblacion) but manufacturing functions would develop in a wedge surrounding transportation routes. Residential functions would grow in wedge-shaped patterns.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Map No. 4, Classic Stellar Map, illustrates the Classic Stellar or Constellation model for Burgos.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>3.

The structure plan, on the other hand is described as the <strong><em>Multi-Point Scenic Agricultural Development Model</em></strong>. The strategic plan makes a case for the preservation of the agricultural character of Burgos arguing that the municipality may be developed as a showcase agricultural community supported by agriculture-based commerce and industry, facilitated by its connectivity to other areas within the province via the road network, and guided by an aspiration to preserve its agricultural character.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>This development plan lends a strong support for economic development that retains Burgos’ agricultural character and protects its important natural resources and pristine environment. Development in Burgos should maintain the quality of life of its people provided by a landscape dominated by farming, resource preservation, scenic areas and many opportunities for outdoor activities, while supporting the harvesting of agricultural products and other land based economic development. In keeping with this image, traditional economic growth should be encouraged in areas where infrastructure already exists or may be easily extended in order to minimize environmental degradation and haphazard transformation of the municipality’s character.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The said strategy is depicted in the following diagramand presented in the Structure/Concept Plan Map (See Map No. 5 and figure 3).</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The diagram illustrates the preferred land use strategy of Burgos which tries to embody the harmony between agriculture-led development and the preservation of the agricultural town character of Burgos, hence the notion of&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>“<em>scenic agricultural development</em>.”</strong> While economic development via agriculture is the goal, the strategy aims to achieve this goal together with proper management of land uses that preserves the countryside character of the municipality. This is done, as shown in the diagram, through the interplay of three main “<strong><em>land use development blocks”</em></strong>or areasin the municipality, namely: (1) the commercial blocks, (2) agricultural blocks and (3) scenic blocks. Land uses in these areas are to be guided by the characteristics sought to be preserved in these blocks as described below. Zoning is thus understood in its ecological sense of designating areas with a distinct or characteristic system determined largely by its environment. Designated by translucent areas in the diagram (red for commercial blocks, green for agricultural blocks and light green scenic blocks), these blocks signify how artificial boundaries in the municipality’s land uses are transcended through the integration of space.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>In order to orchestrate development in these blocks, the model calls for the designation of components of a system that may be designated as specific points of intervention or as the designated components of a multi-point approach resting on the identification of strategic barangays in the municipality. Instead of concentrating on one or two barangays as points of development, the model advocates systematically distributing development efforts in several barangays or “<strong><em>multi-points of growth</em></strong>.”&nbsp; Designated as growth points, these points are identified to provide the impetus for development in agriculture and agro-forestry, commerce and industry, and tourism. Encouraging economic activities in these multiple points will help reduce the likelihood of haphazard strip development along existing roads which may, above all, work to destroy the agricultural character of the municipality.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:table --></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\">\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Figure 3&nbsp;&nbsp; : MULTI-POINT SCENIC AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT MODEL</strong><strong></strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong></strong> Scenic Blocks (Forest/Pasture) Agri-Commercial Point (Poblacion&amp; Adjacent barangays) Agri-ScenicPoints (Concordia-Sapa Grande- Sapa Pequena) &nbsp; Agricultural Blocks (Farmlands) Agri-Forest &amp;Mariculture Points (Ilio-ilio &amp; Cacayasen) Agri-TourismPoint (Cabongaoan Beach, Ilio-ilio) Commercial &amp; Industrial Blocks &nbsp; &nbsp; Potential Coastal Road Agri-Industrial Point (Pogoruac/Papallasen)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</figure>\n<p><!-- /wp:table --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>a. The Land Use Development Blocks</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>This strategy takes-off from the observation that Burgos has acquired an agricultural character through development that has kept large portions of the municipality in unsullied conditions. This plan focuses on amplifying and riding on this characteristic which can be presented as the specific difference Burgos. The rural agricultural character of Burgos exists due to the scenic vistas, large uninterrupted farmlands and pasturelands, forested areas, and limited and scattered development along the roads. This agricultural character should be of importance in planning for the municipality.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The agricultural character of Burgos may be evaluated from three perspectives represented by the three land-use-development-blocks- (1) the scenic blocks, (2) the agricultural block, and (3) the commercial blocks.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Scenic Block</em>s</strong> are conceived from the vantage point of the road connecting the Poblacion to Ilio-ilio. The scenic blocks are to be characterized by views of fairly open areas adjacent to farmlands. More distant views of forested ridgelines shall also be highlighted. The several large farms along the road network shall add to the scenic agricultural character of the municipality. Scattered single family dwellings, some newer and some historic, located along the roadshall be kept. These views should be consciously protected in planning. The municipal protected areas should therefore include those areas within the forestry, pastureland and farmlands.&nbsp; Proper planning and zoning should allow the protection of these areas without limiting economic development through conservation easements. Basically, this should mean that the scenic views will be afforded some level of protection from indiscriminate development. It should be noted that many of the unprotected areas in Burgos are open fields and farms where future development would be highly visible. Development along the roads needs to preserve the open fields and farms and provide a visual and functional relationship of structures to the surrounding landscape. Development guidelines should be established to help protect the open fields along the scenic views from the road while still allowing controlled development.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Commercial / Industrial Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the Poblacion and the national road network passing through the Poblacion which connotes a well-defined route along Burgos to the other municipalities in Western Pangasinan and the sites of agri-industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen. Thesecommercial areasareto be characterizedby mix of land uses with planned pockets of commercial areas, particularly in the Poblacion immediately adjacent barangays. The compact development of the Poblacion with its defined entry points and the fact that itserves as a center for local commercial and institutional activities defines its agricultural and commercial character. The sites of the industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be presented as areas for investments in industrial ventures. Development guidelines should allow and encourage the continuation of the village-style development in this area. Despite the commercialization to be allowed, economic development that promotes the viability of the working landscape should be designed along with forestry and agriculture-related enterprises that preserve the character of Burgos.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agricultural Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the productive agricultural lands in the Poblacion to San Vicente and San Miguel areas, as well as the agricultural areas in the western barangays of the municipality. The goal should be to stimulate appropriate economic development and provide opportunity for individuals to establish agriculture-based ventures in these areas. Economic development in the different barangays should reinforce traditional settlement patterns, protect the agricultural character of the municipality and revitalize village and growth centers. This plan therefore declares that the best interest of Burgos is to see to it that new development occurs in amanner that does not change the basic land use patterns, and consequently the character of Burgos. Therefore, the multiple points identified to function as growth centers below should be the focus for mixed-use, higher intensity development and new growth.&nbsp; Outlying areas should be designed and managed so as not to compromise the agricultural character of Burgos or its important natural resources.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>b. The Multi-Points of Growth</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The identified growth points are: (1) the Agri-Commercial points (i.e., the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac), (2) the Agri-InustriaLpoints (the barangays of PogoruacandPapallasen), (3) the Agri-Forest Mariculture points (i.e., the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen), (4) the Agri-Scenic points (i.e., the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena), and (5) the Agri-Tourism point (i.e., Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio). Calling these growth points by names prefixed by “agriculture” (i.e., Agri) emphasizes the role that agriculture is supposed to play in shaping the development of Burgos in combination with&nbsp; commerce and industry, fishing and aquaculture, tourism, and scenic management of the farmlands, forests and pasturelands.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The model advises that development interventions should be concentrated in these growth points while eventually seeing their effects on the other barangays. By deliberately planning changes in these growth points, harmonious changes in the three land-use-development-blocks are sought. Thus, the growth points are expected to generate further growth in surrounding barangays. The strategy aims to develop growth points as the foci for intervention.&nbsp; Apart from helping de-concentrate development away from the traditional centers, it is also designed to create new catchments for dispersing industry, commerce and people.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Commercial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate commercial activities by inducing entrepreneurs and investors to put up commercial shops and outlets in the Poblacion’s central business district and Pogoruac as the alternative commercial growth center in the opposite end of the municipality.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Industrial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate industrial activities primarily stemming from the invitation for industrial venture investments in two industrial hubs in the two said barangays.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Forest Mariculture Points</em></strong> are set in the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen. Both Ilio-ilo and Cacayasen are the sites forests areas Burgos. With the aim of expanding the protected forests in the municipality, these two barangays shall be the centers of forest management efforts.&nbsp; Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen are also the sites of substantial fishing activities. The coastal Ilio-ilio produces marine catch for local consumption while Cacayasen, with its fishponds is strategically the most favorable area for aquaculture since it is a low lying area where water is retained in natural and artificial ponds. This inherent geographical characteristic of the barangay which may render it non-conducive to farming and raising livestock warrants planning to developing it as a zone for aquaculture.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Scenic Points</em></strong> shall be the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena. Spatially, these three barangays form a belt which is transected by the road network. These three barangays, will serve as sections of the municipality’s transportation and utility corridor. Planning in these barangays should maximize productive land use without severing farm units while facilitating access for producers and harvesters. Guided by the goal of preserving the scenic stretches along the route, every effort should be made to avoid impairment of agricultural lands as well as the pasturelands. Proper planning in these barangays will ensure that the transportation and utility corridor will be managed carefully in the context of the agricultural lands and uses through which it passes. The transportation facilities should complement and serve, rather than harm the municipality’s farmlands, pastureland and agriculture industry through which they pass.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Tourism Point</em></strong> is the Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio. Cabongaoan shall serve as the end-point of a tourism destination which should include the whole of the municipality- branded as “scenic agricultural tourism.” This tourism concept is based on the design that the municipality can be presented as an agricultural community with distinct assets. Visitors can come in search of peaceful relaxation, inspiration, recreation, education and entertainment. Among the tourism assets of Burgos which can be the content of its marketing efforts should be its small town atmosphere, scenery, agricultural tourism, outdoor recreation, festivals and events, and&nbsp; environmental wonders culminating in its clean beach and coast&nbsp; in Cabongaoan.&nbsp; Thus, tourism in Burgos becomes not just an isolated activity in Cabongaoan but a municipality-wide promotion. Cabongaoan should be planned as the final destination at the end of the scenic corridor passing through the agricultural and scenic blocks of the municipality and as destination along the proposed coastal road of the province.&nbsp; To be effective, Cabongaoan should unify Burgos’ agricultural and rural community with beach tourism where functional and emotional benefits will be open to visitors. The whole of Burgos should therefore be considered as tourist destination and not only its beach.<strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n</ul>', 'THE CONCEPT / STRUCTURE PLAN', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '109-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-09-14 11:01:50', '2020-09-14 11:01:50', '', 109, 'https://localhost/git/burgos-website/?p=218', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The central portion of the municipality is identified as a highly restricted agricultural area (HRAA). Thus Burgos is basically designated as an agricultural municipality making vital contributions to the agricultural and industrial development of the province. The PPFP does not mention any particular industries that can be the focus of development in the municipality. Forest lands for preservation are identified in the northernmost part while also mentioning the mangrove areas of Burgos. Reforestation, low susceptibility to landslides and flooding are noted. Among the concerns identified in the municipality are the need for socialized housing in view of its informal settlers, the need for a health service and water and sanitary facilities.&nbsp; The national road passing through Burgos is seen as an important factor that may affect development in the municipality. In like manner, the provincial road to Ilio-Ilio has been earmarked for conversion as national road. The proposed Dasol-Burgos-Agno-Bani-Bolinao coastal road has also been identified as a major intervention in the municipality. Mapped under the PPFP, Burgos is visualized basically for production land use with grazing, pasture and agricultural lands. In line with all these, the municipality of Burgos should be developed as an agricultural municipality able to provide support for the other urban centers of the province given its strategic location.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>1.2.

Alternative 1: Agro-commercial development strategy (Natural Growth Pattern)</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Agricultural growth coupled with commercialization is already the trend in the municipality that coincides with what may be seen as the natural growth pattern that intends to followpast trends.&nbsp; The plan involves letting the urban area and other population centers develop following their natural tendency.&nbsp; Minimal local government intervention is required in implementing this type of development.The primary interventions shall be in protecting prime agricultural areas and providing agricultural support facilities and services. This shall be combined with efforts to increase access to markets through commercialization. Following the natural growth pattern, services and opportunities shall be concentrated in the barangays of the Poblacion and other areas such as the barangay of Pogoruac. Settlements and their support activities shall be developed along the existing major transportation and communication routes. (See Map No. 3, Natural Growth Pattern Map). Maintenance and upgrading of these primary routes shall be done to ensure mobility and to enhance accessibility.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The advantage of this form of development is the decongestion of the sole urban barangay of Burgos. It also means maximizing the use of the major road trunk line.&nbsp; In the long run however, this development plan tends to result in land use patterns that undermine the feasibility and opportunity of designing urban development in potential expansion areas.&nbsp; At the same time, it accelerates the conversion of prime agricultural areas from which the residents derive their daily sustenance. Thus the long-term effect negates the initial advantages gained.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>2.2. Alternative 2: Rapid Commercio-Industrialization Strategy (Classic Stellar or Constellation Pattern)</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Still connected with the first alternative, this second development thrusts includes industrialization as a partner of commercialization. This strategy would require the putting up of support services, facilities and utilities that shall support industrial activities.&nbsp; This strategy takes advantage of the agri-business and agri-industrial potentials of the municipality to complement the agricultural sector. Intensified commercialization shall take the form of providing trading centers (primarily for livestock) highlighting the envisioned roleof the municipality as a livestock provider for the whole province. Industrial and commercial facilities shall be used to attract investments into the municipality.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>This kind of development sees a spatial strategy corresponding to the Classic Stellar or Constellation Model which is based on Hoyt’stheory that urban growth and development tends to follow major transportation and communications routes radiating away from the urban core. Such a development aided by government regulation and intervention assumes the shape of a starfish whose limbs symbolize the radiating arms of development. Applied to Burgos, the Poblacion is to be targeted as the center of &nbsp;development. Growth impetus is expected to spread outwards to the peripheral barangays along the major trunk lines. The concept, therefore, approximates a regulated form of the natural growth model but is also is be-saddled by that model’s negative collateral consequences.The main limitation of this model is that it makes no reference to out of town development.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>This model takes into account the observation that it is common for households to be near road lines, and commercial establishments to be along business thoroughfares. Recognizing that the various transportation routes into an urban area represented greater access, cities tended to grow in wedge-shaped patterns -- or sectors -- emanating from the central business district and centered on major transportation routes. Higher levels of access meant higher land values, thus, many commercial functions would remain in the central business district (the Poblacion) but manufacturing functions would develop in a wedge surrounding transportation routes. Residential functions would grow in wedge-shaped patterns.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Map No. 4, Classic Stellar Map, illustrates the Classic Stellar or Constellation model for Burgos.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>3.

The structure plan, on the other hand is described as the <strong><em>Multi-Point Scenic Agricultural Development Model</em></strong>. The strategic plan makes a case for the preservation of the agricultural character of Burgos arguing that the municipality may be developed as a showcase agricultural community supported by agriculture-based commerce and industry, facilitated by its connectivity to other areas within the province via the road network, and guided by an aspiration to preserve its agricultural character.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>This development plan lends a strong support for economic development that retains Burgos’ agricultural character and protects its important natural resources and pristine environment. Development in Burgos should maintain the quality of life of its people provided by a landscape dominated by farming, resource preservation, scenic areas and many opportunities for outdoor activities, while supporting the harvesting of agricultural products and other land based economic development. In keeping with this image, traditional economic growth should be encouraged in areas where infrastructure already exists or may be easily extended in order to minimize environmental degradation and haphazard transformation of the municipality’s character.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The said strategy is depicted in the following diagramand presented in the Structure/Concept Plan Map (See Map No. 5 and figure 3).</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The diagram illustrates the preferred land use strategy of Burgos which tries to embody the harmony between agriculture-led development and the preservation of the agricultural town character of Burgos, hence the notion of&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>“<em>scenic agricultural development</em>.”</strong> While economic development via agriculture is the goal, the strategy aims to achieve this goal together with proper management of land uses that preserves the countryside character of the municipality. This is done, as shown in the diagram, through the interplay of three main “<strong><em>land use development blocks”</em></strong>or areasin the municipality, namely: (1) the commercial blocks, (2) agricultural blocks and (3) scenic blocks. Land uses in these areas are to be guided by the characteristics sought to be preserved in these blocks as described below. Zoning is thus understood in its ecological sense of designating areas with a distinct or characteristic system determined largely by its environment. Designated by translucent areas in the diagram (red for commercial blocks, green for agricultural blocks and light green scenic blocks), these blocks signify how artificial boundaries in the municipality’s land uses are transcended through the integration of space.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>In order to orchestrate development in these blocks, the model calls for the designation of components of a system that may be designated as specific points of intervention or as the designated components of a multi-point approach resting on the identification of strategic barangays in the municipality. Instead of concentrating on one or two barangays as points of development, the model advocates systematically distributing development efforts in several barangays or “<strong><em>multi-points of growth</em></strong>.”&nbsp; Designated as growth points, these points are identified to provide the impetus for development in agriculture and agro-forestry, commerce and industry, and tourism. Encouraging economic activities in these multiple points will help reduce the likelihood of haphazard strip development along existing roads which may, above all, work to destroy the agricultural character of the municipality.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:table --></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\">\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Figure 3&nbsp;&nbsp; : MULTI-POINT SCENIC AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT MODEL</strong><strong></strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong></strong> Scenic Blocks (Forest/Pasture) Agri-Commercial Point (Poblacion&amp; Adjacent barangays) Agri-ScenicPoints (Concordia-Sapa Grande- Sapa Pequena) &nbsp; Agricultural Blocks (Farmlands) Agri-Forest &amp;Mariculture Points (Ilio-ilio &amp; Cacayasen) Agri-TourismPoint (Cabongaoan Beach, Ilio-ilio) Commercial &amp; Industrial Blocks &nbsp; &nbsp; Potential Coastal Road Agri-Industrial Point (Pogoruac/Papallasen)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</figure>\n<p><!-- /wp:table --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>a. The Land Use Development Blocks</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>This strategy takes-off from the observation that Burgos has acquired an agricultural character through development that has kept large portions of the municipality in unsullied conditions. This plan focuses on amplifying and riding on this characteristic which can be presented as the specific difference Burgos. The rural agricultural character of Burgos exists due to the scenic vistas, large uninterrupted farmlands and pasturelands, forested areas, and limited and scattered development along the roads. This agricultural character should be of importance in planning for the municipality.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The agricultural character of Burgos may be evaluated from three perspectives represented by the three land-use-development-blocks- (1) the scenic blocks, (2) the agricultural block, and (3) the commercial blocks.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Scenic Block</em>s</strong> are conceived from the vantage point of the road connecting the Poblacion to Ilio-ilio. The scenic blocks are to be characterized by views of fairly open areas adjacent to farmlands. More distant views of forested ridgelines shall also be highlighted. The several large farms along the road network shall add to the scenic agricultural character of the municipality. Scattered single family dwellings, some newer and some historic, located along the roadshall be kept. These views should be consciously protected in planning. The municipal protected areas should therefore include those areas within the forestry, pastureland and farmlands.&nbsp; Proper planning and zoning should allow the protection of these areas without limiting economic development through conservation easements. Basically, this should mean that the scenic views will be afforded some level of protection from indiscriminate development. It should be noted that many of the unprotected areas in Burgos are open fields and farms where future development would be highly visible. Development along the roads needs to preserve the open fields and farms and provide a visual and functional relationship of structures to the surrounding landscape. Development guidelines should be established to help protect the open fields along the scenic views from the road while still allowing controlled development.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Commercial / Industrial Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the Poblacion and the national road network passing through the Poblacion which connotes a well-defined route along Burgos to the other municipalities in Western Pangasinan and the sites of agri-industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen. Thesecommercial areasareto be characterizedby mix of land uses with planned pockets of commercial areas, particularly in the Poblacion immediately adjacent barangays. The compact development of the Poblacion with its defined entry points and the fact that itserves as a center for local commercial and institutional activities defines its agricultural and commercial character. The sites of the industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be presented as areas for investments in industrial ventures. Development guidelines should allow and encourage the continuation of the village-style development in this area. Despite the commercialization to be allowed, economic development that promotes the viability of the working landscape should be designed along with forestry and agriculture-related enterprises that preserve the character of Burgos.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agricultural Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the productive agricultural lands in the Poblacion to San Vicente and San Miguel areas, as well as the agricultural areas in the western barangays of the municipality. The goal should be to stimulate appropriate economic development and provide opportunity for individuals to establish agriculture-based ventures in these areas. Economic development in the different barangays should reinforce traditional settlement patterns, protect the agricultural character of the municipality and revitalize village and growth centers. This plan therefore declares that the best interest of Burgos is to see to it that new development occurs in amanner that does not change the basic land use patterns, and consequently the character of Burgos. Therefore, the multiple points identified to function as growth centers below should be the focus for mixed-use, higher intensity development and new growth.&nbsp; Outlying areas should be designed and managed so as not to compromise the agricultural character of Burgos or its important natural resources.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>b. The Multi-Points of Growth</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The identified growth points are: (1) the Agri-Commercial points (i.e., the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac), (2) the Agri-InustriaLpoints (the barangays of PogoruacandPapallasen), (3) the Agri-Forest Mariculture points (i.e., the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen), (4) the Agri-Scenic points (i.e., the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena), and (5) the Agri-Tourism point (i.e., Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio). Calling these growth points by names prefixed by “agriculture” (i.e., Agri) emphasizes the role that agriculture is supposed to play in shaping the development of Burgos in combination with&nbsp; commerce and industry, fishing and aquaculture, tourism, and scenic management of the farmlands, forests and pasturelands.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The model advises that development interventions should be concentrated in these growth points while eventually seeing their effects on the other barangays. By deliberately planning changes in these growth points, harmonious changes in the three land-use-development-blocks are sought. Thus, the growth points are expected to generate further growth in surrounding barangays. The strategy aims to develop growth points as the foci for intervention.&nbsp; Apart from helping de-concentrate development away from the traditional centers, it is also designed to create new catchments for dispersing industry, commerce and people.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Commercial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate commercial activities by inducing entrepreneurs and investors to put up commercial shops and outlets in the Poblacion’s central business district and Pogoruac as the alternative commercial growth center in the opposite end of the municipality.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Industrial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate industrial activities primarily stemming from the invitation for industrial venture investments in two industrial hubs in the two said barangays.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Forest Mariculture Points</em></strong> are set in the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen. Both Ilio-ilo and Cacayasen are the sites forests areas Burgos. With the aim of expanding the protected forests in the municipality, these two barangays shall be the centers of forest management efforts.&nbsp; Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen are also the sites of substantial fishing activities. The coastal Ilio-ilio produces marine catch for local consumption while Cacayasen, with its fishponds is strategically the most favorable area for aquaculture since it is a low lying area where water is retained in natural and artificial ponds. This inherent geographical characteristic of the barangay which may render it non-conducive to farming and raising livestock warrants planning to developing it as a zone for aquaculture.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Scenic Points</em></strong> shall be the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena. Spatially, these three barangays form a belt which is transected by the road network. These three barangays, will serve as sections of the municipality’s transportation and utility corridor. Planning in these barangays should maximize productive land use without severing farm units while facilitating access for producers and harvesters. Guided by the goal of preserving the scenic stretches along the route, every effort should be made to avoid impairment of agricultural lands as well as the pasturelands. Proper planning in these barangays will ensure that the transportation and utility corridor will be managed carefully in the context of the agricultural lands and uses through which it passes. The transportation facilities should complement and serve, rather than harm the municipality’s farmlands, pastureland and agriculture industry through which they pass.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Tourism Point</em></strong> is the Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio. Cabongaoan shall serve as the end-point of a tourism destination which should include the whole of the municipality- branded as “scenic agricultural tourism.” This tourism concept is based on the design that the municipality can be presented as an agricultural community with distinct assets. Visitors can come in search of peaceful relaxation, inspiration, recreation, education and entertainment. Among the tourism assets of Burgos which can be the content of its marketing efforts should be its small town atmosphere, scenery, agricultural tourism, outdoor recreation, festivals and events, and&nbsp; environmental wonders culminating in its clean beach and coast&nbsp; in Cabongaoan.&nbsp; Thus, tourism in Burgos becomes not just an isolated activity in Cabongaoan but a municipality-wide promotion. Cabongaoan should be planned as the final destination at the end of the scenic corridor passing through the agricultural and scenic blocks of the municipality and as destination along the proposed coastal road of the province.&nbsp; To be effective, Cabongaoan should unify Burgos’ agricultural and rural community with beach tourism where functional and emotional benefits will be open to visitors. The whole of Burgos should therefore be considered as tourist destination and not only its beach.<strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>', 'THE CONCEPT / STRUCTURE PLAN', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '109-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-09-14 11:05:29', '2020-09-14 11:05:29', '', 109, 'https://localhost/git/burgos-website/?p=220', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The central portion of the municipality is identified as a highly restricted agricultural area (HRAA). Thus Burgos is basically designated as an agricultural municipality making vital contributions to the agricultural and industrial development of the province. The PPFP does not mention any particular industries that can be the focus of development in the municipality. Forest lands for preservation are identified in the northernmost part while also mentioning the mangrove areas of Burgos. Reforestation, low susceptibility to landslides and flooding are noted. Among the concerns identified in the municipality are the need for socialized housing in view of its informal settlers, the need for a health service and water and sanitary facilities.&nbsp; The national road passing through Burgos is seen as an important factor that may affect development in the municipality. In like manner, the provincial road to Ilio-Ilio has been earmarked for conversion as national road. The proposed Dasol-Burgos-Agno-Bani-Bolinao coastal road has also been identified as a major intervention in the municipality. Mapped under the PPFP, Burgos is visualized basically for production land use with grazing, pasture and agricultural lands. In line with all these, the municipality of Burgos should be developed as an agricultural municipality able to provide support for the other urban centers of the province given its strategic location.</p>\n</li>\n<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>1.2.

Population</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>It has been projected that the municipality’s population will increase to 20,995 people by 2022. This population increase demands that the municipality provides more infrastructure facilities and services to address population demands.&nbsp; Apart from that, the provision of the needed land requirement to accommodate the population surplus as well as the observed informal settlements should be taken into account.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>1.4.

The upgrading of the existing commercial business district and the public market should be prioritized extending to stretches along the national highway. A satellite commercial district in the other end of the municipality should be developed.These commercial support facilities shall serve asalternative growth centers. The commercial focus of the municipality shall be further enhanced by marketing its central position to the other surrounding municipalities in the province.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>- Expansion of communication and transportation services</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The local government shall continue in efforts to establish moderntransportation and communication facilities and services tosupport economic revitalization.&nbsp; In order to speed up profitable economic transactions, the municipality shall provide for these facilities highlighting its connectivity with other municipalities. An area also targeted for expansion is the avenue of Internet access for all capable residents in order for them to be linked to the global information technology net. Transport activities along the major roads shall also be expanded.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>- Identification and advancement of tourism potentials</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Tourism shall be included in the thrusts of the municipality focused in its coastal areas.&nbsp; The tourism potentials of the municipality shall be roused by way of presenting the rural character of Burgos showcased along the major road network and connected to the coastal tourist attraction.&nbsp; Support facilities and activities shall be planned for and developed through specific tourism objectives on the coastal barangay radiating to adjacent barangays.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>- Promotion of Environmental Protection</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The maintenance of the natural resources of the municipality shall fostered by emphasizing scenic tourism and protection. Environmental protection programs shall be designed especially in the management of the limited forest resources of the municipality while keeping in mind the agricultural thrusts of the municipality. This shall be carried out through the laying down of appropriate plans.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>-&nbsp; Politico – Administrative machinery</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The development plans shall be spearheaded by vibrant politico-administrative machinery with appropriate and the entities tasked for implementation.&nbsp; Staffing pattern and reorganization pursuant to the Local Government Code, and the formulation of performance enhancement and evaluation systems to improve the delivery of basic services required by the growing population should be undertaken as early as the first year of the planning period.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>2.1. Alternative 1: Agro-commercial development strategy (Natural Growth Pattern)</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Agricultural growth coupled with commercialization is already the trend in the municipality that coincides with what may be seen as the natural growth pattern that intends to followpast trends.&nbsp; The plan involves letting the urban area and other population centers develop following their natural tendency.&nbsp; Minimal local government intervention is required in implementing this type of development.The primary interventions shall be in protecting prime agricultural areas and providing agricultural support facilities and services. This shall be combined with efforts to increase access to markets through commercialization. Following the natural growth pattern, services and opportunities shall be concentrated in the barangays of the Poblacion and other areas such as the barangay of Pogoruac. Settlements and their support activities shall be developed along the existing major transportation and communication routes. (See Map No. 3, Natural Growth Pattern Map). Maintenance and upgrading of these primary routes shall be done to ensure mobility and to enhance accessibility.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The advantage of this form of development is the decongestion of the sole urban barangay of Burgos. It also means maximizing the use of the major road trunk line.&nbsp; In the long run however, this development plan tends to result in land use patterns that undermine the feasibility and opportunity of designing urban development in potential expansion areas.&nbsp; At the same time, it accelerates the conversion of prime agricultural areas from which the residents derive their daily sustenance. Thus the long-term effect negates the initial advantages gained.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>2.2. Alternative 2: Rapid Commercio-Industrialization Strategy (Classic Stellar or Constellation Pattern)</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Still connected with the first alternative, this second development thrusts includes industrialization as a partner of commercialization. This strategy would require the putting up of support services, facilities and utilities that shall support industrial activities.&nbsp; This strategy takes advantage of the agri-business and agri-industrial potentials of the municipality to complement the agricultural sector. Intensified commercialization shall take the form of providing trading centers (primarily for livestock) highlighting the envisioned roleof the municipality as a livestock provider for the whole province. Industrial and commercial facilities shall be used to attract investments into the municipality.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>This kind of development sees a spatial strategy corresponding to the Classic Stellar or Constellation Model which is based on Hoyt’stheory that urban growth and development tends to follow major transportation and communications routes radiating away from the urban core. Such a development aided by government regulation and intervention assumes the shape of a starfish whose limbs symbolize the radiating arms of development. Applied to Burgos, the Poblacion is to be targeted as the center of &nbsp;development. Growth impetus is expected to spread outwards to the peripheral barangays along the major trunk lines. The concept, therefore, approximates a regulated form of the natural growth model but is also is be-saddled by that model’s negative collateral consequences.The main limitation of this model is that it makes no reference to out of town development.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>This model takes into account the observation that it is common for households to be near road lines, and commercial establishments to be along business thoroughfares. Recognizing that the various transportation routes into an urban area represented greater access, cities tended to grow in wedge-shaped patterns -- or sectors -- emanating from the central business district and centered on major transportation routes. Higher levels of access meant higher land values, thus, many commercial functions would remain in the central business district (the Poblacion) but manufacturing functions would develop in a wedge surrounding transportation routes. Residential functions would grow in wedge-shaped patterns.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Map No. 4, Classic Stellar Map, illustrates the Classic Stellar or Constellation model for Burgos.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>3.

It is assumed that the major growth center shall provide specialized facilities and services, which shall trickle out to the growth nodes.&nbsp; It also serves as the external link of the municipality to other municipalities and cities.&nbsp; The nodes, on the other hand, provide support to the major growth center as its captive market of both labor and resources, and at the same time disperse development services to its influence areas.&nbsp; An efficient circulation system is required to achieve complementarity of the major growth center and the nodes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>3.2.&nbsp; Structure Plan</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The following structure plan is based on the preferred development strategy of Burgos described as<strong><em>agro-commercio-industrial &amp;agri-tourism management strategy</em></strong>. The structure plan, on the other hand is described as the <strong><em>Multi-Point Scenic Agricultural Development Model</em></strong>. The strategic plan makes a case for the preservation of the agricultural character of Burgos arguing that the municipality may be developed as a showcase agricultural community supported by agriculture-based commerce and industry, facilitated by its connectivity to other areas within the province via the road network, and guided by an aspiration to preserve its agricultural character.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>This development plan lends a strong support for economic development that retains Burgos’ agricultural character and protects its important natural resources and pristine environment. Development in Burgos should maintain the quality of life of its people provided by a landscape dominated by farming, resource preservation, scenic areas and many opportunities for outdoor activities, while supporting the harvesting of agricultural products and other land based economic development. In keeping with this image, traditional economic growth should be encouraged in areas where infrastructure already exists or may be easily extended in order to minimize environmental degradation and haphazard transformation of the municipality’s character.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The said strategy is depicted in the following diagramand presented in the Structure/Concept Plan Map (See Map No. 5 and figure 3).</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The diagram illustrates the preferred land use strategy of Burgos which tries to embody the harmony between agriculture-led development and the preservation of the agricultural town character of Burgos, hence the notion of&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>“<em>scenic agricultural development</em>.”</strong> While economic development via agriculture is the goal, the strategy aims to achieve this goal together with proper management of land uses that preserves the countryside character of the municipality. This is done, as shown in the diagram, through the interplay of three main “<strong><em>land use development blocks”</em></strong>or areasin the municipality, namely: (1) the commercial blocks, (2) agricultural blocks and (3) scenic blocks. Land uses in these areas are to be guided by the characteristics sought to be preserved in these blocks as described below. Zoning is thus understood in its ecological sense of designating areas with a distinct or characteristic system determined largely by its environment. Designated by translucent areas in the diagram (red for commercial blocks, green for agricultural blocks and light green scenic blocks), these blocks signify how artificial boundaries in the municipality’s land uses are transcended through the integration of space.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>In order to orchestrate development in these blocks, the model calls for the designation of components of a system that may be designated as specific points of intervention or as the designated components of a multi-point approach resting on the identification of strategic barangays in the municipality. Instead of concentrating on one or two barangays as points of development, the model advocates systematically distributing development efforts in several barangays or “<strong><em>multi-points of growth</em></strong>.”&nbsp; Designated as growth points, these points are identified to provide the impetus for development in agriculture and agro-forestry, commerce and industry, and tourism. Encouraging economic activities in these multiple points will help reduce the likelihood of haphazard strip development along existing roads which may, above all, work to destroy the agricultural character of the municipality.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:table --></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\">\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Figure 3&nbsp;&nbsp; : MULTI-POINT SCENIC AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT MODEL</strong><strong></strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong></strong> Scenic Blocks (Forest/Pasture) Agri-Commercial Point (Poblacion&amp; Adjacent barangays) Agri-ScenicPoints (Concordia-Sapa Grande- Sapa Pequena) &nbsp; Agricultural Blocks (Farmlands) Agri-Forest &amp;Mariculture Points (Ilio-ilio &amp; Cacayasen) Agri-TourismPoint (Cabongaoan Beach, Ilio-ilio) Commercial &amp; Industrial Blocks &nbsp; &nbsp; Potential Coastal Road Agri-Industrial Point (Pogoruac/Papallasen)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</figure>\n<p><!-- /wp:table --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>a. The Land Use Development Blocks</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>This strategy takes-off from the observation that Burgos has acquired an agricultural character through development that has kept large portions of the municipality in unsullied conditions. This plan focuses on amplifying and riding on this characteristic which can be presented as the specific difference Burgos. The rural agricultural character of Burgos exists due to the scenic vistas, large uninterrupted farmlands and pasturelands, forested areas, and limited and scattered development along the roads. This agricultural character should be of importance in planning for the municipality.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The agricultural character of Burgos may be evaluated from three perspectives represented by the three land-use-development-blocks- (1) the scenic blocks, (2) the agricultural block, and (3) the commercial blocks.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Scenic Block</em>s</strong> are conceived from the vantage point of the road connecting the Poblacion to Ilio-ilio. The scenic blocks are to be characterized by views of fairly open areas adjacent to farmlands. More distant views of forested ridgelines shall also be highlighted. The several large farms along the road network shall add to the scenic agricultural character of the municipality. Scattered single family dwellings, some newer and some historic, located along the roadshall be kept. These views should be consciously protected in planning. The municipal protected areas should therefore include those areas within the forestry, pastureland and farmlands.&nbsp; Proper planning and zoning should allow the protection of these areas without limiting economic development through conservation easements. Basically, this should mean that the scenic views will be afforded some level of protection from indiscriminate development. It should be noted that many of the unprotected areas in Burgos are open fields and farms where future development would be highly visible. Development along the roads needs to preserve the open fields and farms and provide a visual and functional relationship of structures to the surrounding landscape. Development guidelines should be established to help protect the open fields along the scenic views from the road while still allowing controlled development.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Commercial / Industrial Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the Poblacion and the national road network passing through the Poblacion which connotes a well-defined route along Burgos to the other municipalities in Western Pangasinan and the sites of agri-industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen. Thesecommercial areasareto be characterizedby mix of land uses with planned pockets of commercial areas, particularly in the Poblacion immediately adjacent barangays. The compact development of the Poblacion with its defined entry points and the fact that itserves as a center for local commercial and institutional activities defines its agricultural and commercial character. The sites of the industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be presented as areas for investments in industrial ventures. Development guidelines should allow and encourage the continuation of the village-style development in this area. Despite the commercialization to be allowed, economic development that promotes the viability of the working landscape should be designed along with forestry and agriculture-related enterprises that preserve the character of Burgos.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agricultural Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the productive agricultural lands in the Poblacion to San Vicente and San Miguel areas, as well as the agricultural areas in the western barangays of the municipality. The goal should be to stimulate appropriate economic development and provide opportunity for individuals to establish agriculture-based ventures in these areas. Economic development in the different barangays should reinforce traditional settlement patterns, protect the agricultural character of the municipality and revitalize village and growth centers. This plan therefore declares that the best interest of Burgos is to see to it that new development occurs in amanner that does not change the basic land use patterns, and consequently the character of Burgos. Therefore, the multiple points identified to function as growth centers below should be the focus for mixed-use, higher intensity development and new growth.&nbsp; Outlying areas should be designed and managed so as not to compromise the agricultural character of Burgos or its important natural resources.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>b. The Multi-Points of Growth</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The identified growth points are: (1) the Agri-Commercial points (i.e., the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac), (2) the Agri-InustriaLpoints (the barangays of PogoruacandPapallasen), (3) the Agri-Forest Mariculture points (i.e., the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen), (4) the Agri-Scenic points (i.e., the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena), and (5) the Agri-Tourism point (i.e., Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio). Calling these growth points by names prefixed by “agriculture” (i.e., Agri) emphasizes the role that agriculture is supposed to play in shaping the development of Burgos in combination with&nbsp; commerce and industry, fishing and aquaculture, tourism, and scenic management of the farmlands, forests and pasturelands.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The model advises that development interventions should be concentrated in these growth points while eventually seeing their effects on the other barangays. By deliberately planning changes in these growth points, harmonious changes in the three land-use-development-blocks are sought. Thus, the growth points are expected to generate further growth in surrounding barangays. The strategy aims to develop growth points as the foci for intervention.&nbsp; Apart from helping de-concentrate development away from the traditional centers, it is also designed to create new catchments for dispersing industry, commerce and people.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Commercial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate commercial activities by inducing entrepreneurs and investors to put up commercial shops and outlets in the Poblacion’s central business district and Pogoruac as the alternative commercial growth center in the opposite end of the municipality.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Industrial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate industrial activities primarily stemming from the invitation for industrial venture investments in two industrial hubs in the two said barangays.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Forest Mariculture Points</em></strong> are set in the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen. Both Ilio-ilo and Cacayasen are the sites forests areas Burgos. With the aim of expanding the protected forests in the municipality, these two barangays shall be the centers of forest management efforts.&nbsp; Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen are also the sites of substantial fishing activities. The coastal Ilio-ilio produces marine catch for local consumption while Cacayasen, with its fishponds is strategically the most favorable area for aquaculture since it is a low lying area where water is retained in natural and artificial ponds. This inherent geographical characteristic of the barangay which may render it non-conducive to farming and raising livestock warrants planning to developing it as a zone for aquaculture.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Scenic Points</em></strong> shall be the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena. Spatially, these three barangays form a belt which is transected by the road network. These three barangays, will serve as sections of the municipality’s transportation and utility corridor. Planning in these barangays should maximize productive land use without severing farm units while facilitating access for producers and harvesters. Guided by the goal of preserving the scenic stretches along the route, every effort should be made to avoid impairment of agricultural lands as well as the pasturelands. Proper planning in these barangays will ensure that the transportation and utility corridor will be managed carefully in the context of the agricultural lands and uses through which it passes. The transportation facilities should complement and serve, rather than harm the municipality’s farmlands, pastureland and agriculture industry through which they pass.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Tourism Point</em></strong> is the Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio. Cabongaoan shall serve as the end-point of a tourism destination which should include the whole of the municipality- branded as “scenic agricultural tourism.” This tourism concept is based on the design that the municipality can be presented as an agricultural community with distinct assets. Visitors can come in search of peaceful relaxation, inspiration, recreation, education and entertainment. Among the tourism assets of Burgos which can be the content of its marketing efforts should be its small town atmosphere, scenery, agricultural tourism, outdoor recreation, festivals and events, and&nbsp; environmental wonders culminating in its clean beach and coast&nbsp; in Cabongaoan.&nbsp; Thus, tourism in Burgos becomes not just an isolated activity in Cabongaoan but a municipality-wide promotion. Cabongaoan should be planned as the final destination at the end of the scenic corridor passing through the agricultural and scenic blocks of the municipality and as destination along the proposed coastal road of the province.&nbsp; To be effective, Cabongaoan should unify Burgos’ agricultural and rural community with beach tourism where functional and emotional benefits will be open to visitors. The whole of Burgos should therefore be considered as tourist destination and not only its beach.<strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p></ul>', 'THE CONCEPT / STRUCTURE PLAN', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '109-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-09-14 11:06:03', '2020-09-14 11:06:03', '', 109, 'https://localhost/git/burgos-website/?p=221', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><!-- wp:list--></p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:none;\">\n<li><strong>1.1.&nbsp; Functional Role of the Municipality</strong>\n<p>The municipality of Burgos is recognized as an agricultural and agro-industrial municipality.&nbsp; The Provincial Physical Framework Plan (PPFP) of the Province of Pangasinan classifies Burgos as a satellite growth center, being connected to surrounding municipalities. The central portion of the municipality is identified as a highly restricted agricultural area (HRAA). Thus Burgos is basically designated as an agricultural municipality making vital contributions to the agricultural and industrial development of the province. The PPFP does not mention any particular industries that can be the focus of development in the municipality. Forest lands for preservation are identified in the northernmost part while also mentioning the mangrove areas of Burgos. Reforestation, low susceptibility to landslides and flooding are noted. Among the concerns identified in the municipality are the need for socialized housing in view of its informal settlers, the need for a health service and water and sanitary facilities.&nbsp; The national road passing through Burgos is seen as an important factor that may affect development in the municipality. In like manner, the provincial road to Ilio-Ilio has been earmarked for conversion as national road. The proposed Dasol-Burgos-Agno-Bani-Bolinao coastal road has also been identified as a major intervention in the municipality. Mapped under the PPFP, Burgos is visualized basically for production land use with grazing, pasture and agricultural lands. In line with all these, the municipality of Burgos should be developed as an agricultural municipality able to provide support for the other urban centers of the province given its strategic location.</p>\n</li>\n<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>1.2.

Population</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>It has been projected that the municipality’s population will increase to 20,995 people by 2022. This population increase demands that the municipality provides more infrastructure facilities and services to address population demands.&nbsp; Apart from that, the provision of the needed land requirement to accommodate the population surplus as well as the observed informal settlements should be taken into account.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>1.4.

Nevertheless, critical areas within the municipality also pose barriers in extensive development.&nbsp; Occurrence of erosion can be detrimental to agricultural crops including urban area expansion and development.&nbsp; It also poses danger to life, limb and property of residents.

This is planned in order to augment the expected profitable output of agricultural products.&nbsp; The principles and technology underlying the success of local government projects already put in place in the municipality shall be adopted to improve agricultural production and the processing of agricultural products.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>-Expansion of commercial activities</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Inducing entrepreneurs and investors to put up commercial shops and outlets in identified points in the municipality shall be emphasized. The upgrading of the existing commercial business district and the public market should be prioritized extending to stretches along the national highway. A satellite commercial district in the other end of the municipality should be developed.These commercial support facilities shall serve asalternative growth centers. The commercial focus of the municipality shall be further enhanced by marketing its central position to the other surrounding municipalities in the province.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>- Expansion of communication and transportation services</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The local government shall continue in efforts to establish moderntransportation and communication facilities and services tosupport economic revitalization.&nbsp; In order to speed up profitable economic transactions, the municipality shall provide for these facilities highlighting its connectivity with other municipalities. An area also targeted for expansion is the avenue of Internet access for all capable residents in order for them to be linked to the global information technology net. Transport activities along the major roads shall also be expanded.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>- Identification and advancement of tourism potentials</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Tourism shall be included in the thrusts of the municipality focused in its coastal areas.&nbsp; The tourism potentials of the municipality shall be roused by way of presenting the rural character of Burgos showcased along the major road network and connected to the coastal tourist attraction.&nbsp; Support facilities and activities shall be planned for and developed through specific tourism objectives on the coastal barangay radiating to adjacent barangays.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>- Promotion of Environmental Protection</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The maintenance of the natural resources of the municipality shall fostered by emphasizing scenic tourism and protection. Environmental protection programs shall be designed especially in the management of the limited forest resources of the municipality while keeping in mind the agricultural thrusts of the municipality. This shall be carried out through the laying down of appropriate plans.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>-&nbsp; Politico – Administrative machinery</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The development plans shall be spearheaded by vibrant politico-administrative machinery with appropriate and the entities tasked for implementation.&nbsp; Staffing pattern and reorganization pursuant to the Local Government Code, and the formulation of performance enhancement and evaluation systems to improve the delivery of basic services required by the growing population should be undertaken as early as the first year of the planning period.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>2.1. Alternative 1: Agro-commercial development strategy (Natural Growth Pattern)</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Agricultural growth coupled with commercialization is already the trend in the municipality that coincides with what may be seen as the natural growth pattern that intends to followpast trends.&nbsp; The plan involves letting the urban area and other population centers develop following their natural tendency.&nbsp; Minimal local government intervention is required in implementing this type of development.The primary interventions shall be in protecting prime agricultural areas and providing agricultural support facilities and services. This shall be combined with efforts to increase access to markets through commercialization. Following the natural growth pattern, services and opportunities shall be concentrated in the barangays of the Poblacion and other areas such as the barangay of Pogoruac. Settlements and their support activities shall be developed along the existing major transportation and communication routes. (See Map No. 3, Natural Growth Pattern Map). Maintenance and upgrading of these primary routes shall be done to ensure mobility and to enhance accessibility.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The advantage of this form of development is the decongestion of the sole urban barangay of Burgos. It also means maximizing the use of the major road trunk line.&nbsp; In the long run however, this development plan tends to result in land use patterns that undermine the feasibility and opportunity of designing urban development in potential expansion areas.&nbsp; At the same time, it accelerates the conversion of prime agricultural areas from which the residents derive their daily sustenance. Thus the long-term effect negates the initial advantages gained.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>2.2. Alternative 2: Rapid Commercio-Industrialization Strategy (Classic Stellar or Constellation Pattern)</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Still connected with the first alternative, this second development thrusts includes industrialization as a partner of commercialization. This strategy would require the putting up of support services, facilities and utilities that shall support industrial activities.&nbsp; This strategy takes advantage of the agri-business and agri-industrial potentials of the municipality to complement the agricultural sector. Intensified commercialization shall take the form of providing trading centers (primarily for livestock) highlighting the envisioned roleof the municipality as a livestock provider for the whole province. Industrial and commercial facilities shall be used to attract investments into the municipality.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>This kind of development sees a spatial strategy corresponding to the Classic Stellar or Constellation Model which is based on Hoyt’stheory that urban growth and development tends to follow major transportation and communications routes radiating away from the urban core. Such a development aided by government regulation and intervention assumes the shape of a starfish whose limbs symbolize the radiating arms of development. Applied to Burgos, the Poblacion is to be targeted as the center of &nbsp;development. Growth impetus is expected to spread outwards to the peripheral barangays along the major trunk lines. The concept, therefore, approximates a regulated form of the natural growth model but is also is be-saddled by that model’s negative collateral consequences.The main limitation of this model is that it makes no reference to out of town development.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>This model takes into account the observation that it is common for households to be near road lines, and commercial establishments to be along business thoroughfares. Recognizing that the various transportation routes into an urban area represented greater access, cities tended to grow in wedge-shaped patterns -- or sectors -- emanating from the central business district and centered on major transportation routes. Higher levels of access meant higher land values, thus, many commercial functions would remain in the central business district (the Poblacion) but manufacturing functions would develop in a wedge surrounding transportation routes. Residential functions would grow in wedge-shaped patterns.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Map No. 4, Classic Stellar Map, illustrates the Classic Stellar or Constellation model for Burgos.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>3. THE STRUCTURE PLAN</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The definitive development thrust chosen for Burgos has been guided, to a large extent, by the municipality’s formulated vision and mission which, in turn, shaped the goals and strategies formulated from the different sectoral studies.

The structure plan, on the other hand is described as the <strong><em>Multi-Point Scenic Agricultural Development Model</em></strong>. The strategic plan makes a case for the preservation of the agricultural character of Burgos arguing that the municipality may be developed as a showcase agricultural community supported by agriculture-based commerce and industry, facilitated by its connectivity to other areas within the province via the road network, and guided by an aspiration to preserve its agricultural character.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>This development plan lends a strong support for economic development that retains Burgos’ agricultural character and protects its important natural resources and pristine environment. Development in Burgos should maintain the quality of life of its people provided by a landscape dominated by farming, resource preservation, scenic areas and many opportunities for outdoor activities, while supporting the harvesting of agricultural products and other land based economic development. In keeping with this image, traditional economic growth should be encouraged in areas where infrastructure already exists or may be easily extended in order to minimize environmental degradation and haphazard transformation of the municipality’s character.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The said strategy is depicted in the following diagramand presented in the Structure/Concept Plan Map (See Map No. 5 and figure 3).</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The diagram illustrates the preferred land use strategy of Burgos which tries to embody the harmony between agriculture-led development and the preservation of the agricultural town character of Burgos, hence the notion of&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>“<em>scenic agricultural development</em>.”</strong> While economic development via agriculture is the goal, the strategy aims to achieve this goal together with proper management of land uses that preserves the countryside character of the municipality. This is done, as shown in the diagram, through the interplay of three main “<strong><em>land use development blocks”</em></strong>or areasin the municipality, namely: (1) the commercial blocks, (2) agricultural blocks and (3) scenic blocks. Land uses in these areas are to be guided by the characteristics sought to be preserved in these blocks as described below. Zoning is thus understood in its ecological sense of designating areas with a distinct or characteristic system determined largely by its environment. Designated by translucent areas in the diagram (red for commercial blocks, green for agricultural blocks and light green scenic blocks), these blocks signify how artificial boundaries in the municipality’s land uses are transcended through the integration of space.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>In order to orchestrate development in these blocks, the model calls for the designation of components of a system that may be designated as specific points of intervention or as the designated components of a multi-point approach resting on the identification of strategic barangays in the municipality. Instead of concentrating on one or two barangays as points of development, the model advocates systematically distributing development efforts in several barangays or “<strong><em>multi-points of growth</em></strong>.”&nbsp; Designated as growth points, these points are identified to provide the impetus for development in agriculture and agro-forestry, commerce and industry, and tourism. Encouraging economic activities in these multiple points will help reduce the likelihood of haphazard strip development along existing roads which may, above all, work to destroy the agricultural character of the municipality.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:table --></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\">\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Figure 3&nbsp;&nbsp; : MULTI-POINT SCENIC AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT MODEL</strong><strong></strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong></strong> Scenic Blocks (Forest/Pasture) Agri-Commercial Point (Poblacion&amp; Adjacent barangays) Agri-ScenicPoints (Concordia-Sapa Grande- Sapa Pequena) &nbsp; Agricultural Blocks (Farmlands) Agri-Forest &amp;Mariculture Points (Ilio-ilio &amp; Cacayasen) Agri-TourismPoint (Cabongaoan Beach, Ilio-ilio) Commercial &amp; Industrial Blocks &nbsp; &nbsp; Potential Coastal Road Agri-Industrial Point (Pogoruac/Papallasen)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</figure>\n<p><!-- /wp:table --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>a. The Land Use Development Blocks</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>This strategy takes-off from the observation that Burgos has acquired an agricultural character through development that has kept large portions of the municipality in unsullied conditions. This plan focuses on amplifying and riding on this characteristic which can be presented as the specific difference Burgos. The rural agricultural character of Burgos exists due to the scenic vistas, large uninterrupted farmlands and pasturelands, forested areas, and limited and scattered development along the roads. This agricultural character should be of importance in planning for the municipality.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The agricultural character of Burgos may be evaluated from three perspectives represented by the three land-use-development-blocks- (1) the scenic blocks, (2) the agricultural block, and (3) the commercial blocks.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Scenic Block</em>s</strong> are conceived from the vantage point of the road connecting the Poblacion to Ilio-ilio. The scenic blocks are to be characterized by views of fairly open areas adjacent to farmlands. More distant views of forested ridgelines shall also be highlighted. The several large farms along the road network shall add to the scenic agricultural character of the municipality. Scattered single family dwellings, some newer and some historic, located along the roadshall be kept. These views should be consciously protected in planning. The municipal protected areas should therefore include those areas within the forestry, pastureland and farmlands.&nbsp; Proper planning and zoning should allow the protection of these areas without limiting economic development through conservation easements. Basically, this should mean that the scenic views will be afforded some level of protection from indiscriminate development. It should be noted that many of the unprotected areas in Burgos are open fields and farms where future development would be highly visible. Development along the roads needs to preserve the open fields and farms and provide a visual and functional relationship of structures to the surrounding landscape. Development guidelines should be established to help protect the open fields along the scenic views from the road while still allowing controlled development.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Commercial / Industrial Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the Poblacion and the national road network passing through the Poblacion which connotes a well-defined route along Burgos to the other municipalities in Western Pangasinan and the sites of agri-industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen. Thesecommercial areasareto be characterizedby mix of land uses with planned pockets of commercial areas, particularly in the Poblacion immediately adjacent barangays. The compact development of the Poblacion with its defined entry points and the fact that itserves as a center for local commercial and institutional activities defines its agricultural and commercial character. The sites of the industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be presented as areas for investments in industrial ventures. Development guidelines should allow and encourage the continuation of the village-style development in this area. Despite the commercialization to be allowed, economic development that promotes the viability of the working landscape should be designed along with forestry and agriculture-related enterprises that preserve the character of Burgos.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agricultural Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the productive agricultural lands in the Poblacion to San Vicente and San Miguel areas, as well as the agricultural areas in the western barangays of the municipality. The goal should be to stimulate appropriate economic development and provide opportunity for individuals to establish agriculture-based ventures in these areas. Economic development in the different barangays should reinforce traditional settlement patterns, protect the agricultural character of the municipality and revitalize village and growth centers. This plan therefore declares that the best interest of Burgos is to see to it that new development occurs in amanner that does not change the basic land use patterns, and consequently the character of Burgos. Therefore, the multiple points identified to function as growth centers below should be the focus for mixed-use, higher intensity development and new growth.&nbsp; Outlying areas should be designed and managed so as not to compromise the agricultural character of Burgos or its important natural resources.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>b. The Multi-Points of Growth</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The identified growth points are: (1) the Agri-Commercial points (i.e., the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac), (2) the Agri-InustriaLpoints (the barangays of PogoruacandPapallasen), (3) the Agri-Forest Mariculture points (i.e., the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen), (4) the Agri-Scenic points (i.e., the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena), and (5) the Agri-Tourism point (i.e., Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio). Calling these growth points by names prefixed by “agriculture” (i.e., Agri) emphasizes the role that agriculture is supposed to play in shaping the development of Burgos in combination with&nbsp; commerce and industry, fishing and aquaculture, tourism, and scenic management of the farmlands, forests and pasturelands.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The model advises that development interventions should be concentrated in these growth points while eventually seeing their effects on the other barangays. By deliberately planning changes in these growth points, harmonious changes in the three land-use-development-blocks are sought. Thus, the growth points are expected to generate further growth in surrounding barangays. The strategy aims to develop growth points as the foci for intervention.&nbsp; Apart from helping de-concentrate development away from the traditional centers, it is also designed to create new catchments for dispersing industry, commerce and people.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Commercial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate commercial activities by inducing entrepreneurs and investors to put up commercial shops and outlets in the Poblacion’s central business district and Pogoruac as the alternative commercial growth center in the opposite end of the municipality.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Industrial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate industrial activities primarily stemming from the invitation for industrial venture investments in two industrial hubs in the two said barangays.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Forest Mariculture Points</em></strong> are set in the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen. Both Ilio-ilo and Cacayasen are the sites forests areas Burgos. With the aim of expanding the protected forests in the municipality, these two barangays shall be the centers of forest management efforts.&nbsp; Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen are also the sites of substantial fishing activities. The coastal Ilio-ilio produces marine catch for local consumption while Cacayasen, with its fishponds is strategically the most favorable area for aquaculture since it is a low lying area where water is retained in natural and artificial ponds. This inherent geographical characteristic of the barangay which may render it non-conducive to farming and raising livestock warrants planning to developing it as a zone for aquaculture.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Scenic Points</em></strong> shall be the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena. Spatially, these three barangays form a belt which is transected by the road network. These three barangays, will serve as sections of the municipality’s transportation and utility corridor. Planning in these barangays should maximize productive land use without severing farm units while facilitating access for producers and harvesters. Guided by the goal of preserving the scenic stretches along the route, every effort should be made to avoid impairment of agricultural lands as well as the pasturelands. Proper planning in these barangays will ensure that the transportation and utility corridor will be managed carefully in the context of the agricultural lands and uses through which it passes. The transportation facilities should complement and serve, rather than harm the municipality’s farmlands, pastureland and agriculture industry through which they pass.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Tourism Point</em></strong> is the Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio. Cabongaoan shall serve as the end-point of a tourism destination which should include the whole of the municipality- branded as “scenic agricultural tourism.” This tourism concept is based on the design that the municipality can be presented as an agricultural community with distinct assets. Visitors can come in search of peaceful relaxation, inspiration, recreation, education and entertainment. Among the tourism assets of Burgos which can be the content of its marketing efforts should be its small town atmosphere, scenery, agricultural tourism, outdoor recreation, festivals and events, and&nbsp; environmental wonders culminating in its clean beach and coast&nbsp; in Cabongaoan.&nbsp; Thus, tourism in Burgos becomes not just an isolated activity in Cabongaoan but a municipality-wide promotion. Cabongaoan should be planned as the final destination at the end of the scenic corridor passing through the agricultural and scenic blocks of the municipality and as destination along the proposed coastal road of the province.&nbsp; To be effective, Cabongaoan should unify Burgos’ agricultural and rural community with beach tourism where functional and emotional benefits will be open to visitors. The whole of Burgos should therefore be considered as tourist destination and not only its beach.<strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n</ul>', 'THE CONCEPT / STRUCTURE PLAN', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '109-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-09-14 11:06:26', '2020-09-14 11:06:26', '', 109, 'https://localhost/git/burgos-website/?p=222', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The central portion of the municipality is identified as a highly restricted agricultural area (HRAA). Thus Burgos is basically designated as an agricultural municipality making vital contributions to the agricultural and industrial development of the province. The PPFP does not mention any particular industries that can be the focus of development in the municipality. Forest lands for preservation are identified in the northernmost part while also mentioning the mangrove areas of Burgos. Reforestation, low susceptibility to landslides and flooding are noted. Among the concerns identified in the municipality are the need for socialized housing in view of its informal settlers, the need for a health service and water and sanitary facilities.&nbsp; The national road passing through Burgos is seen as an important factor that may affect development in the municipality. In like manner, the provincial road to Ilio-Ilio has been earmarked for conversion as national road. The proposed Dasol-Burgos-Agno-Bani-Bolinao coastal road has also been identified as a major intervention in the municipality. Mapped under the PPFP, Burgos is visualized basically for production land use with grazing, pasture and agricultural lands. In line with all these, the municipality of Burgos should be developed as an agricultural municipality able to provide support for the other urban centers of the province given its strategic location.</p></li>\n<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>1.2.

The upgrading of the existing commercial business district and the public market should be prioritized extending to stretches along the national highway. A satellite commercial district in the other end of the municipality should be developed.These commercial support facilities shall serve asalternative growth centers. The commercial focus of the municipality shall be further enhanced by marketing its central position to the other surrounding municipalities in the province.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>- Expansion of communication and transportation services</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The local government shall continue in efforts to establish moderntransportation and communication facilities and services tosupport economic revitalization.&nbsp; In order to speed up profitable economic transactions, the municipality shall provide for these facilities highlighting its connectivity with other municipalities. An area also targeted for expansion is the avenue of Internet access for all capable residents in order for them to be linked to the global information technology net. Transport activities along the major roads shall also be expanded.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>- Identification and advancement of tourism potentials</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Tourism shall be included in the thrusts of the municipality focused in its coastal areas.&nbsp; The tourism potentials of the municipality shall be roused by way of presenting the rural character of Burgos showcased along the major road network and connected to the coastal tourist attraction.&nbsp; Support facilities and activities shall be planned for and developed through specific tourism objectives on the coastal barangay radiating to adjacent barangays.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>- Promotion of Environmental Protection</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The maintenance of the natural resources of the municipality shall fostered by emphasizing scenic tourism and protection.

Alternative 1: Agro-commercial development strategy (Natural Growth Pattern)</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Agricultural growth coupled with commercialization is already the trend in the municipality that coincides with what may be seen as the natural growth pattern that intends to followpast trends.&nbsp; The plan involves letting the urban area and other population centers develop following their natural tendency.&nbsp; Minimal local government intervention is required in implementing this type of development.The primary interventions shall be in protecting prime agricultural areas and providing agricultural support facilities and services. This shall be combined with efforts to increase access to markets through commercialization. Following the natural growth pattern, services and opportunities shall be concentrated in the barangays of the Poblacion and other areas such as the barangay of Pogoruac. Settlements and their support activities shall be developed along the existing major transportation and communication routes. (See Map No. 3, Natural Growth Pattern Map). Maintenance and upgrading of these primary routes shall be done to ensure mobility and to enhance accessibility.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The advantage of this form of development is the decongestion of the sole urban barangay of Burgos. It also means maximizing the use of the major road trunk line.&nbsp; In the long run however, this development plan tends to result in land use patterns that undermine the feasibility and opportunity of designing urban development in potential expansion areas.&nbsp; At the same time, it accelerates the conversion of prime agricultural areas from which the residents derive their daily sustenance. Thus the long-term effect negates the initial advantages gained.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>2.2. Alternative 2: Rapid Commercio-Industrialization Strategy (Classic Stellar or Constellation Pattern)</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Still connected with the first alternative, this second development thrusts includes industrialization as a partner of commercialization. This strategy would require the putting up of support services, facilities and utilities that shall support industrial activities.&nbsp; This strategy takes advantage of the agri-business and agri-industrial potentials of the municipality to complement the agricultural sector. Intensified commercialization shall take the form of providing trading centers (primarily for livestock) highlighting the envisioned roleof the municipality as a livestock provider for the whole province. Industrial and commercial facilities shall be used to attract investments into the municipality.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>This kind of development sees a spatial strategy corresponding to the Classic Stellar or Constellation Model which is based on Hoyt’stheory that urban growth and development tends to follow major transportation and communications routes radiating away from the urban core. Such a development aided by government regulation and intervention assumes the shape of a starfish whose limbs symbolize the radiating arms of development. Applied to Burgos, the Poblacion is to be targeted as the center of &nbsp;development. Growth impetus is expected to spread outwards to the peripheral barangays along the major trunk lines. The concept, therefore, approximates a regulated form of the natural growth model but is also is be-saddled by that model’s negative collateral consequences.The main limitation of this model is that it makes no reference to out of town development.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>This model takes into account the observation that it is common for households to be near road lines, and commercial establishments to be along business thoroughfares. Recognizing that the various transportation routes into an urban area represented greater access, cities tended to grow in wedge-shaped patterns -- or sectors -- emanating from the central business district and centered on major transportation routes. Higher levels of access meant higher land values, thus, many commercial functions would remain in the central business district (the Poblacion) but manufacturing functions would develop in a wedge surrounding transportation routes. Residential functions would grow in wedge-shaped patterns.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Map No. 4, Classic Stellar Map, illustrates the Classic Stellar or Constellation model for Burgos.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>3.

The structure plan, on the other hand is described as the <strong><em>Multi-Point Scenic Agricultural Development Model</em></strong>. The strategic plan makes a case for the preservation of the agricultural character of Burgos arguing that the municipality may be developed as a showcase agricultural community supported by agriculture-based commerce and industry, facilitated by its connectivity to other areas within the province via the road network, and guided by an aspiration to preserve its agricultural character.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>This development plan lends a strong support for economic development that retains Burgos’ agricultural character and protects its important natural resources and pristine environment. Development in Burgos should maintain the quality of life of its people provided by a landscape dominated by farming, resource preservation, scenic areas and many opportunities for outdoor activities, while supporting the harvesting of agricultural products and other land based economic development. In keeping with this image, traditional economic growth should be encouraged in areas where infrastructure already exists or may be easily extended in order to minimize environmental degradation and haphazard transformation of the municipality’s character.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The said strategy is depicted in the following diagramand presented in the Structure/Concept Plan Map (See Map No. 5 and figure 3).</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The diagram illustrates the preferred land use strategy of Burgos which tries to embody the harmony between agriculture-led development and the preservation of the agricultural town character of Burgos, hence the notion of&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>“<em>scenic agricultural development</em>.”</strong> While economic development via agriculture is the goal, the strategy aims to achieve this goal together with proper management of land uses that preserves the countryside character of the municipality. This is done, as shown in the diagram, through the interplay of three main “<strong><em>land use development blocks”</em></strong>or areasin the municipality, namely: (1) the commercial blocks, (2) agricultural blocks and (3) scenic blocks. Land uses in these areas are to be guided by the characteristics sought to be preserved in these blocks as described below. Zoning is thus understood in its ecological sense of designating areas with a distinct or characteristic system determined largely by its environment. Designated by translucent areas in the diagram (red for commercial blocks, green for agricultural blocks and light green scenic blocks), these blocks signify how artificial boundaries in the municipality’s land uses are transcended through the integration of space.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>In order to orchestrate development in these blocks, the model calls for the designation of components of a system that may be designated as specific points of intervention or as the designated components of a multi-point approach resting on the identification of strategic barangays in the municipality. Instead of concentrating on one or two barangays as points of development, the model advocates systematically distributing development efforts in several barangays or “<strong><em>multi-points of growth</em></strong>.”&nbsp; Designated as growth points, these points are identified to provide the impetus for development in agriculture and agro-forestry, commerce and industry, and tourism. Encouraging economic activities in these multiple points will help reduce the likelihood of haphazard strip development along existing roads which may, above all, work to destroy the agricultural character of the municipality.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:table --></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\">\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Figure 3&nbsp;&nbsp; : MULTI-POINT SCENIC AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT MODEL</strong><strong></strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong></strong> Scenic Blocks (Forest/Pasture) Agri-Commercial Point (Poblacion&amp; Adjacent barangays) Agri-ScenicPoints (Concordia-Sapa Grande- Sapa Pequena) &nbsp; Agricultural Blocks (Farmlands) Agri-Forest &amp;Mariculture Points (Ilio-ilio &amp; Cacayasen) Agri-TourismPoint (Cabongaoan Beach, Ilio-ilio) Commercial &amp; Industrial Blocks &nbsp; &nbsp; Potential Coastal Road Agri-Industrial Point (Pogoruac/Papallasen)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</figure>\n<p><!-- /wp:table --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>a. The Land Use Development Blocks</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>This strategy takes-off from the observation that Burgos has acquired an agricultural character through development that has kept large portions of the municipality in unsullied conditions. This plan focuses on amplifying and riding on this characteristic which can be presented as the specific difference Burgos. The rural agricultural character of Burgos exists due to the scenic vistas, large uninterrupted farmlands and pasturelands, forested areas, and limited and scattered development along the roads. This agricultural character should be of importance in planning for the municipality.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The agricultural character of Burgos may be evaluated from three perspectives represented by the three land-use-development-blocks- (1) the scenic blocks, (2) the agricultural block, and (3) the commercial blocks.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Scenic Block</em>s</strong> are conceived from the vantage point of the road connecting the Poblacion to Ilio-ilio. The scenic blocks are to be characterized by views of fairly open areas adjacent to farmlands. More distant views of forested ridgelines shall also be highlighted. The several large farms along the road network shall add to the scenic agricultural character of the municipality. Scattered single family dwellings, some newer and some historic, located along the roadshall be kept. These views should be consciously protected in planning. The municipal protected areas should therefore include those areas within the forestry, pastureland and farmlands.&nbsp; Proper planning and zoning should allow the protection of these areas without limiting economic development through conservation easements. Basically, this should mean that the scenic views will be afforded some level of protection from indiscriminate development. It should be noted that many of the unprotected areas in Burgos are open fields and farms where future development would be highly visible. Development along the roads needs to preserve the open fields and farms and provide a visual and functional relationship of structures to the surrounding landscape. Development guidelines should be established to help protect the open fields along the scenic views from the road while still allowing controlled development.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Commercial / Industrial Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the Poblacion and the national road network passing through the Poblacion which connotes a well-defined route along Burgos to the other municipalities in Western Pangasinan and the sites of agri-industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen. Thesecommercial areasareto be characterizedby mix of land uses with planned pockets of commercial areas, particularly in the Poblacion immediately adjacent barangays. The compact development of the Poblacion with its defined entry points and the fact that itserves as a center for local commercial and institutional activities defines its agricultural and commercial character. The sites of the industrial hubs in Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be presented as areas for investments in industrial ventures. Development guidelines should allow and encourage the continuation of the village-style development in this area. Despite the commercialization to be allowed, economic development that promotes the viability of the working landscape should be designed along with forestry and agriculture-related enterprises that preserve the character of Burgos.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agricultural Blocks</em></strong>are conceived from the vantage point of the productive agricultural lands in the Poblacion to San Vicente and San Miguel areas, as well as the agricultural areas in the western barangays of the municipality. The goal should be to stimulate appropriate economic development and provide opportunity for individuals to establish agriculture-based ventures in these areas. Economic development in the different barangays should reinforce traditional settlement patterns, protect the agricultural character of the municipality and revitalize village and growth centers. This plan therefore declares that the best interest of Burgos is to see to it that new development occurs in amanner that does not change the basic land use patterns, and consequently the character of Burgos. Therefore, the multiple points identified to function as growth centers below should be the focus for mixed-use, higher intensity development and new growth.&nbsp; Outlying areas should be designed and managed so as not to compromise the agricultural character of Burgos or its important natural resources.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>b. The Multi-Points of Growth</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The identified growth points are: (1) the Agri-Commercial points (i.e., the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac), (2) the Agri-InustriaLpoints (the barangays of PogoruacandPapallasen), (3) the Agri-Forest Mariculture points (i.e., the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen), (4) the Agri-Scenic points (i.e., the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena), and (5) the Agri-Tourism point (i.e., Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio). Calling these growth points by names prefixed by “agriculture” (i.e., Agri) emphasizes the role that agriculture is supposed to play in shaping the development of Burgos in combination with&nbsp; commerce and industry, fishing and aquaculture, tourism, and scenic management of the farmlands, forests and pasturelands.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The model advises that development interventions should be concentrated in these growth points while eventually seeing their effects on the other barangays. By deliberately planning changes in these growth points, harmonious changes in the three land-use-development-blocks are sought. Thus, the growth points are expected to generate further growth in surrounding barangays. The strategy aims to develop growth points as the foci for intervention.&nbsp; Apart from helping de-concentrate development away from the traditional centers, it is also designed to create new catchments for dispersing industry, commerce and people.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Commercial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Poblacion and Pogoruac shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate commercial activities by inducing entrepreneurs and investors to put up commercial shops and outlets in the Poblacion’s central business district and Pogoruac as the alternative commercial growth center in the opposite end of the municipality.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Industrial Points</em></strong> in the two barangays of Pogoruac and Papallasen shall be the focus of interventions that can stimulate industrial activities primarily stemming from the invitation for industrial venture investments in two industrial hubs in the two said barangays.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Forest Mariculture Points</em></strong> are set in the barangays of Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen. Both Ilio-ilo and Cacayasen are the sites forests areas Burgos. With the aim of expanding the protected forests in the municipality, these two barangays shall be the centers of forest management efforts.&nbsp; Ilio-ilio and Cacayasen are also the sites of substantial fishing activities. The coastal Ilio-ilio produces marine catch for local consumption while Cacayasen, with its fishponds is strategically the most favorable area for aquaculture since it is a low lying area where water is retained in natural and artificial ponds. This inherent geographical characteristic of the barangay which may render it non-conducive to farming and raising livestock warrants planning to developing it as a zone for aquaculture.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Scenic Points</em></strong> shall be the barangays of Concordia, Sapa Grande and Sapa Pequena. Spatially, these three barangays form a belt which is transected by the road network. These three barangays, will serve as sections of the municipality’s transportation and utility corridor. Planning in these barangays should maximize productive land use without severing farm units while facilitating access for producers and harvesters. Guided by the goal of preserving the scenic stretches along the route, every effort should be made to avoid impairment of agricultural lands as well as the pasturelands. Proper planning in these barangays will ensure that the transportation and utility corridor will be managed carefully in the context of the agricultural lands and uses through which it passes. The transportation facilities should complement and serve, rather than harm the municipality’s farmlands, pastureland and agriculture industry through which they pass.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Agri-Tourism Point</em></strong> is the Cabongaoan Beach in barangay Ilio-ilio. Cabongaoan shall serve as the end-point of a tourism destination which should include the whole of the municipality- branded as “scenic agricultural tourism.” This tourism concept is based on the design that the municipality can be presented as an agricultural community with distinct assets. Visitors can come in search of peaceful relaxation, inspiration, recreation, education and entertainment. Among the tourism assets of Burgos which can be the content of its marketing efforts should be its small town atmosphere, scenery, agricultural tourism, outdoor recreation, festivals and events, and&nbsp; environmental wonders culminating in its clean beach and coast&nbsp; in Cabongaoan.&nbsp; Thus, tourism in Burgos becomes not just an isolated activity in Cabongaoan but a municipality-wide promotion. Cabongaoan should be planned as the final destination at the end of the scenic corridor passing through the agricultural and scenic blocks of the municipality and as destination along the proposed coastal road of the province.&nbsp; To be effective, Cabongaoan should unify Burgos’ agricultural and rural community with beach tourism where functional and emotional benefits will be open to visitors. The whole of Burgos should therefore be considered as tourist destination and not only its beach.<strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n</ul>', 'THE CONCEPT / STRUCTURE PLAN', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '109-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-09-14 11:06:55', '2020-09-14 11:06:55', '', 109, 'https://localhost/git/burgos-website/?p=223', 0, 'revision', '', 0);
